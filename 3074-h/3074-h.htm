      PREFACE
    </h2>
    <p>
      This book was written to supply a definite need. Its preparation was
      undertaken at the urgent request of booksellers and others who have felt
      the lack of a satisfactory medium of introduction to bird life for little
      children. As such, and in no sense whatever as a competitor with the many
      excellent books on this subject, but rather to supplement these, this
      volume has been written.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its primary purpose is to interest the little child in, and to make him
      acquainted with, those feathered friends he is most likely to see. Because
      there is no method of approach to the child mind equal to the story, this
      method of conveying information has been adopted. So far as I am aware the
      book is unique in this respect. In its preparation an earnest effort has
      been made to present as far as possible the important facts regarding the
      appearance, habits and characteristics of our feathered neighbors. It is
      intended to be at once a story book and an authoritative handbook. While
      it is intended for little children, it is hoped that children of larger
      growth may find in it much of both interest and helpfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Louis Agassiz Fuertes, artist and naturalist, has marvelously
      supplemented such value as may be in the text by his wonderful drawings in
      full color. They were made especially for this volume and are so accurate,
      so true to life, that study of them will enable any one to identify the
      species shown. I am greatly indebted to Mr. Fuertes for his cooperation in
      the endeavor to make this book of real assistance to the beginner in the
      study of our native birds.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is offered to the reader without apologies of any sort. It was written
      as a labor of love&mdash;love for little children and love for the birds.
      If as a result of it even a few children are led to a keener interest in
      and better understanding of our feathered friends, its purpose will have
      been accomplished.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. Jenny Wren Arrives.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lipperty-lipperty-lip scampered Peter Rabbit behind the tumble-down stone
      wall along one side of the Old Orchard. It was early in the morning, very
      early in the morning. In fact, jolly, bright Mr. Sun had hardly begun his
      daily climb up in the blue, blue sky. It was nothing unusual for Peter to
      see jolly Mr. Sun get up in the morning. It would be more unusual for
      Peter not to see him, for you know Peter is a great hand to stay out all
      night and not go back to the dear Old Briar-patch, where his home is,
      until the hour when most folks are just getting out of bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter had been out all night this time, but he wasn't sleepy, not the
      least teeny, weeny bit. You see, sweet Mistress Spring had arrived, and
      there was so much happening on every side, and Peter was so afraid he
      would miss something, that he wouldn't have slept at all if he could have
      helped it. Peter had come over to the Old Orchard so early this morning to
      see if there had been any new arrivals the day before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Birds are funny creatures,&rdquo; said Peter, as he hopped over a low place in
      the old stone wall and was fairly in the Old Orchard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, tut, tut, tut, tut!&rdquo; cried a rather sharp scolding voice. &ldquo;Tut, tut,
      tut, tut, tut! You don't know what you are talking about, Peter Rabbit.
      They are not funny creatures at all. They are the most sensible folks in
      all the wide world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter cut a long hop short right in the middle, to sit up with shining
      eyes. &ldquo;Oh, Jenny Wren, I'm so glad to see you! When did you arrive?&rdquo; he
      cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Wren and I have just arrived, and thank goodness we are here at
      last,&rdquo; replied Jenny Wren, fussing about, as only she can, in a branch
      above Peter. &ldquo;I never was more thankful in my life to see a place than I
      am right this minute to see the Old Orchard once more. It seems ages and
      ages since we left it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you are so fond of it what did you leave it for?&rdquo; demanded
      Peter. &ldquo;It is just as I said before&mdash;you birds are funny creatures.
      You never stay put; at least a lot of you don't. Sammy Jay and Tommy Tit
      the Chickadee and Drummer the Woodpecker and a few others have a little
      sense; they don't go off on long, foolish journeys. But the rest of you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, tut, tut, tut, tut!&rdquo; interrupted Jenny Wren. &ldquo;You don't know what
      you are talking about, and no one sounds so silly as one who tries to talk
      about something he knows nothing about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter chuckled. &ldquo;That tongue of yours is just as sharp as ever,&rdquo; said he.
      &ldquo;But just the same it is good to hear it. We certainly would miss it. I
      was beginning to be a little worried for fear something might have
      happened to you so that you wouldn't be back here this summer. You know me
      well enough, Jenny Wren, to know that you can't hurt me with your tongue,
      sharp as it is, so you may as well save your breath to tell me a few
      things I want to know. Now if you are as fond of the Old Orchard as you
      pretend to be, why did you ever leave it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jenny Wren's bright eyes snapped. &ldquo;Why do you eat?&rdquo; she asked tartly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I'm hungry,&rdquo; replied Peter promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you eat if there were nothing to eat?&rdquo; snapped Jenny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a silly question,&rdquo; retorted Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more silly than asking me why I leave the Old Orchard,&rdquo; replied Jenny.
      &ldquo;Do give us birds credit for a little common sense, Peter. We can't live
      without eating any more than you can, and in winter there is no food at
      all here for most of us, so we go where there is food. Those who are lucky
      enough to eat the kinds of food that can be found here in winter stay
      here. They are lucky. That's what they are&mdash;lucky. Still&mdash;&rdquo;
       Jenny Wren paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still what?&rdquo; prompted Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder sometimes if you folks who are at home all the time know just
      what a blessed place home is,&rdquo; replied Jenny. &ldquo;It is only six months since
      we went south, but I said it seems ages, and it does. The best part of
      going away is coming home. I don't care if that does sound rather mixed;
      it is true just the same. It isn't home down there in the sunny South,
      even if we do spend as much time there as we do here. THIS is home, and
      there's no place like it! What's that, Mr. Wren? I haven't seen all the
      Great World? Perhaps I haven't, but I've seen enough of it, let me tell
      you that! Anyone who travels a thousand miles twice a year as we do has a
      right to express an opinion, especially if they have used their eyes as I
      have mine. There is no place like home, and you needn't try to tease me by
      pretending that there is. My dear, I know you; you are just as tickled to
      be back here as I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He sings as if he were,&rdquo; said Peter, for all the time Mr. Wren was
      singing with all his might.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jenny Wren looked over at Mr. Wren fondly. &ldquo;Isn't he a dear to sing to me
      like that? And isn't it a perfectly beautiful spring song?&rdquo; said she.
      Then, without waiting for Peter to reply, her tongue rattled on. &ldquo;I do
      wish he would be careful. Sometimes I am afraid he will overdo. Just look
      at him now! He is singing so hard that he is shaking all over. He always
      is that way. There is one thing true about us Wrens, and this is that when
      we do things we do them with all our might. When we work we work with all
      our might. When Mr. Wren sings he sings with all his might.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, when you scold you scold with all your might,&rdquo; interrupted Peter
      mischievously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jenny Wren opened her mouth for a sharp reply, but laughed instead. &ldquo;I
      suppose I do scold a good deal,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;but if I didn't goodness knows
      who wouldn't impose on us. I can't bear to be imposed on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you have a pleasant journey up from the sunny South?&rdquo; asked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fairly pleasant,&rdquo; replied Jenny. &ldquo;We took it rather easily, Some birds
      hurry right through without stopping, but I should think they would be
      tired to death when they arrive. We rest whenever we are tired, and just
      follow along behind Mistress Spring, keeping far enough behind so that if
      she has to turn back we will not get caught by Jack Frost. It gives us
      time to get our new suits on the way. You know everybody expects you to
      have new things when you return home. How do you like my new suit, Peter?&rdquo;
       Jenny bobbed and twisted and turned to show it off. It was plain to see
      that she was very proud of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much,&rdquo; replied Peter. &ldquo;I am very fond of brown. Brown and gray are
      my favorite colors.&rdquo; You know Peter's own coat is brown and gray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is one of the most sensible things I have heard you say,&rdquo; chattered
      Jenny Wren. &ldquo;The more I see of bright colors the better I like brown. It
      always is in good taste. It goes well with almost everything. It is neat
      and it is useful. If there is need of getting out of sight in a hurry you
      can do it if you wear brown. But if you wear bright colors it isn't so
      easy. I never envy anybody who happens to have brighter clothes than mine.
      I've seen dreadful things happen all because of wearing bright colors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; demanded Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd rather not talk about them,&rdquo; declared Jenny in a very emphatic way.
      &ldquo;'Way down where we spent the winter some of the feathered folks who live
      there all the year round wear the brightest and most beautiful suits I've
      ever seen. They are simply gorgeous. But I've noticed that in times of
      danger these are the folks dreadful things happen to. You see they simply
      can't get out of sight. For my part I would far rather be simply and
      neatly dressed and feel safe than to wear wonderful clothes and never know
      a minute's peace. Why, there are some families I know of which, because of
      their beautiful suits, have been so hunted by men that hardly any are
      left. But gracious, Peter Rabbit, I can't sit here all day talking to you!
      I must find out who else has arrived in the Old Orchard and must look my
      old house over to see if it is fit to live in.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. The Old Orchard Bully.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Peter Rabbit's eyes twinkled when Jenny Wren said that she must look her
      old house over to see if it was fit to live in. &ldquo;I can save you that
      trouble,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Jenny's voice was very sharp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only that our old house is already occupied,&rdquo; replied Peter. &ldquo;Bully the
      English Sparrow has been living in it for the last two months. In fact, he
      already has a good-sized family there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; screamed Jenny and Mr. Wren together. Then without even saying
      good-by to Peter, they flew in a great rage to see if he had told them the
      truth. Presently he heard them scolding as fast as their tongues could go,
      and this is very fast indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much good that will do them,&rdquo; chuckled Peter. &ldquo;They will have to find a
      new house this year. All the sharp tongues in the world couldn't budge
      Bully the English sparrow. My, my, my, my, just hear that racket! I think
      I'll go over and see what is going on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Peter hopped to a place where he could get a good view of Jenny Wren's
      old home and still not be too far from the safety of the old stone wall.
      Jenny Wren's old home had been in a hole in one of the old apple-trees.
      Looking over to it, Peter could see Mrs. Bully sitting in the little round
      doorway and quite filling it. She was shrieking excitedly. Hopping and
      flitting from twig to twig close by were Jenny and Mr. Wren, their tails
      pointing almost straight up to the sky, and scolding as fast as they could
      make their tongues go. Flying savagely at one and then at the other, and
      almost drowning their voices with his own harsh cries, was Bully himself.
      He was perhaps one fourth larger than Mr. Wren, although he looked half
      again as big. But for the fact that his new spring suit was very dirty,
      due to his fondness for taking dust baths and the fact that he cares
      nothing about his personal appearance and takes no care of himself, he
      would have been a fairly good-looking fellow. His back was more or less of
      an ashy color with black and chestnut stripes. His wings were brown with a
      white bar on each. His throat and breast were black, and below that he was
      of a dirty white. The sides of his throat were white and the back of his
      neck chestnut.
    </p>
    <p>
      By ruffling up his feathers and raising his wings slightly as he hopped
      about, he managed to make himself appear much bigger than he really was.
      He looked like a regular little fighting savage. The noise had brought all
      the other birds in the Old Orchard to see what was going on, and every one
      of them was screaming and urging Jenny and Mr. Wren to stand up for their
      rights. Not one of them had a good word for Bully and his wife. It
      certainly was a disgraceful neighborhood squabble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bully the English Sparrow is a born fighter. He never is happier than when
      he is in the midst of a fight or a fuss of some kind. The fact that all
      his neighbors were against him didn't bother Bully in the least.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jenny and Mr. Wren are no cowards, but the two together were no match for
      Bully. In fact, Bully did not hesitate to fly fiercely at any of the
      onlookers who came near enough, not even when they were twice his own
      size. They could have driven him from the Old Orchard had they set out to,
      but just by his boldness and appearance he made them afraid to try.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the time Mrs. Bully sat in the little round doorway, encouraging him.
      She knew that as long as she sat there it would be impossible for either
      Jenny or Mr. Wren to get in. Truth to tell, she was enjoying it all, for
      she is as quarrelsome and as fond of fighting as is Bully himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a sneak! You're a robber! That's my house, and the sooner you get
      out of it the better!&rdquo; shrieked Jenny Wren, jerking her tail with every
      word as she hopped about just out of reach of Bully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may have been your house once, but it is mine now, you little
      snip-of-nothing!&rdquo; cried Bully, rushing at her like a little fury. &ldquo;Just
      try to put us out if you dare! You didn't make this house in the first
      place, and you deserted it when you went south last fall. It's mine now,
      and there isn't anybody in the Old Orchard who can put me out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Rabbit nodded. &ldquo;He's right there,&rdquo; muttered Peter. &ldquo;I don't like him
      and never will, but it is true that he has a perfect right to that house.
      People who go off and leave things for half a year shouldn't expect to
      find them just as they left them. My, my, my what a dreadful noise! Why
      don't they all get together and drive Bully and Mrs. Bully out of the Old
      Orchard? If they don't I'm afraid he will drive them out. No one likes to
      live with such quarrelsome neighbors. They don't belong over in this
      country, anyway, and we would be a lot better off if they were not here.
      But I must say I do have to admire their spunk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All the time Bully was darting savagely at this one and that one and
      having a thoroughly good time, which is more than could be said of any one
      else, except Mrs. Bully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll teach you folks to know that I am in the Old Orchard to stay!&rdquo;
       shrieked Bully. &ldquo;If you don't like it, why don't you fight? I am not
      afraid of any of you or all of you together.&rdquo; This was boasting, plain
      boasting, but it was effective. He actually made the other birds believe
      it. Not one of them dared stand up to him and fight. They were content to
      call him a bully and all the bad names they could think of, but that did
      nothing to help Jenny and Mr. Wren recover their house. Calling another
      bad names never hurts him. Brave deeds and not brave words are what count.
    </p>
    <p>
      How long that disgraceful squabble in the Old Orchard would have lasted
      had it not been for something which happened, no one knows. Right in the
      midst of it some one discovered Black Pussy, the cat who lives in Farmer
      Brown's house, stealing up through the Old Orchard, her tail twitching and
      her yellow eyes glaring eagerly. She had heard that dreadful racket and
      suspected that in the midst of such excitement she might have a chance to
      catch one of the feathered folks. You can always trust Black Pussy to be
      on hand at a time like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner was she discovered than everything else was forgotten. With
      Bully in the lead, and Jenny and Mr. Wren close behind him, all the birds
      turned their attention to Black Pussy. She was the enemy of all, and they
      straightway forgot their own quarrel. Only Mrs. Bully remained where she
      was, in the little round doorway of her house. She intended to take no
      chances, but she added her voice to the general racket. How those birds
      did shriek and scream! They darted down almost into the face of Black
      Pussy, and none went nearer than Bully the English Sparrow and Jenny Wren.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Black Pussy hates to be the center of so much attention. She knew
      that, now she had been discovered, there wasn't a chance in the world for
      her to catch one of those Old Orchard folks. So, with tail still twitching
      angrily, she turned and, with such dignity as she could, left the Old
      Orchard. Clear to the edge of it the birds followed, shrieking, screaming,
      calling her bad names, and threatening to do all sorts of dreadful things
      to her, quite as if they really could.
    </p>
    <p>
      When finally she disappeared towards Farmer Brown's barn, those angry
      voices changed. It was such a funny change that Peter Rabbit laughed right
      out. Instead of anger there was triumph in every note as everybody
      returned to attend to his own affairs. Jenny and Mr. Wren seemed to have
      forgotten all about Bully and his wife in their old house. They flew to
      another part of the Old Orchard, there to talk it all over and rest and
      get their breath. Peter Rabbit waited to see if they would not come over
      near enough to him for a little more gossip. But they didn't, and finally
      Peter started for his home in the dear Old Briar-patch. All the way there
      he chuckled as he thought of the spunky way in which Jenny and Mr. Wren
      had stood up for their rights.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. Jenny Has a Good Word for Some Sparrows.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The morning after the fight between Jenny and Mr. Wren and Bully the
      English Sparrow found Peter Rabbit in the Old Orchard again. He was so
      curious to know what Jenny Wren would do for a house that nothing but some
      very great danger could have kept him away from there. Truth to tell,
      Peter was afraid that not being able to have their old house, Jenny and
      Mr. Wren would decide to leave the Old Orchard altogether. So it was with
      a great deal of relief that as he hopped over a low place in the old stone
      wall he heard Mr. Wren singing with all his might.
    </p>
    <p>
      The song was coming from quite the other side of the Old Orchard from
      where Bully and Mrs. Bully had set up housekeeping. Peter hurried over. He
      found Mr. Wren right away, but at first saw nothing of Jenny. He was just
      about to ask after her when he caught sight of her with a tiny stick in
      her bill. She snapped her sharp little eyes at him, but for once her
      tongue was still. You see, she couldn't talk and carry that stick at the
      same time. Peter watched her and saw her disappear in a little hole in a
      big branch of one of the old apple-trees. Hardly had she popped in than
      she popped out again. This time her mouth was free, and so was her tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better stop singing and help me,&rdquo; she said to Mr. Wren sharply. Mr.
      Wren obediently stopped singing and began to hunt for a tiny little twig
      such as Jenny had taken into that hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; exclaimed Peter. &ldquo;It didn't take you long to find a new house, did
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; snapped Jenny &ldquo;We can't afford to sit around wasting time
      like some folk I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter grinned and looked a little foolish, but he didn't resent it. You
      see he was quite used to that sort of thing. &ldquo;Aren't you afraid that Bully
      will try to drive you out of that house?&rdquo; he ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jenny Wren's sharp little eyes snapped more than ever. &ldquo;I'd like to see
      him try!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;That doorway's too small for him to get more than his
      head in. And if he tries putting his head in while I'm inside, I'll peck
      his eyes out! She said this so fiercely that Peter laughed right out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really believe you would,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly would,&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;Now I can't stop to talk to you, Peter
      Rabbit, because I'm too busy. Mr. Wren, you ought to know that that stick
      is too big.&rdquo; Jenny snatched it out of Mr. Wren's mouth and dropped it on
      the ground, while Mr. Wren meekly went to hunt for another. Jenny joined
      him, and as Peter watched them he understood why Jenny is so often spoken
      of as a feathered busybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time Peter Rabbit watched Jenny and Mr. Wren carry sticks and
      straws into that little hole until it seemed to him they were trying to
      fill the whole inside of the tree. Just watching them made Peter
      positively tired. Mr. Wren would stop every now and then to sing, but
      Jenny didn't waste a minute. In spite of that she managed to talk just the
      same.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose Little Friend the Song Sparrow got here some time ago,&rdquo; said
      she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter nodded. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I saw him only a day or two ago over by the
      Laughing Brook, and although he wouldn't say so, I'm sure that he has a
      nest and eggs already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jenny Wren jerked her tail and nodded her head vigorously. &ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo;
       said she. &ldquo;He doesn't have to make as long a journey as we do, so he gets
      here sooner. Did you ever in your life see such a difference as there is
      between Little Friend and his cousin, Bully? Everybody loves Little
      Friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more Peter nodded. &ldquo;That's right,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Everybody does love
      Little Friend. It makes me feel sort of all glad inside just to hear him
      sing. I guess it makes everybody feel that way. I wonder why we so seldom
      see him up here in the Old Orchard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he likes damp places with plenty of bushes better,&rdquo; replied Jenny
      Wren. &ldquo;It wouldn't do for everybody to like the same kind of a place. He
      isn't a tree bird, anyway. He likes to be on or near the ground. You will
      never find his nest much above the ground, not more than a foot or two.
      Quite often it is on the ground. Of course I prefer Mr. Wren's song, but I
      must admit that Little Friend has one of the happiest songs of any one I
      know. Then, too, he is so modest, just like us Wrens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter turned his head aside to hide a smile, for if there is anybody who
      delights in being both seen and heard it is Jenny Wren, while Little
      Friend the Song Sparrow is shy and retiring, content to make all the world
      glad with his song, but preferring to keep out of sight as much as
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jenny chattered on as she hunted for some more material for her nest. &ldquo;I
      suppose you've noticed,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that he and his wife dress very much
      alike. They don't go in for bright colors any more than we Wrens do. They
      show good taste. I like the little brown caps they wear, and the way their
      breasts and sides are streaked with brown. Then, too, they are such useful
      folks. It is a pity that that nuisance of a Bully doesn't learn something
      from them. I suppose they stay rather later than we do in the fall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Peter. &ldquo;They don't go until Jack Frost makes them. I don't
      know of any one that we miss more than we do them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speaking of the sparrow family, did you see anything of Whitethroat?&rdquo;
       asked Jenny Wren, as she rested for a moment in the doorway of her new
      house and looked down at Peter Rabbit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter's face brightened. &ldquo;I should say I did!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;He stopped
      for a few days on his way north. I only wish he would stay here all the
      time. But he seems to think there is no place like the Great Woods of the
      North. I could listen all day to his song. Do you know what he always
      seems to be saying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; demanded Jenny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I live happ-i-ly, happ-i-ly, happ-i-ly,&rdquo; replied Peter. &ldquo;I guess he must
      too, because he makes other people so happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jenny nodded in her usual emphatic way. &ldquo;I don't know him as well as I do
      some of the others,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;but when I have seen him down in the South
      he always has appeared to me to be a perfect gentleman. He is social, too;
      he likes to travel with others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've noticed that,&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;He almost always has company when he
      passes through here. Some of those Sparrows are so much alike that it is
      hard for me to tell them apart, but I can always tell Whitethroat because
      he is one of the largest of the tribe and has such a lovely white throat.
      He really is handsome with his black and white cap and that bright yellow
      spot before each eye. I am told that he is very dearly loved up in the
      north where he makes his home. They say he sings all the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose Scratcher the Fox Sparrow has been along too,&rdquo; said Jenny. &ldquo;He
      also started sometime before we did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Peter. &ldquo;He spent one night in the dear Old Briar-patch. He
      is fine looking too, the biggest of all the Sparrow tribe, and HOW he can
      sing. The only thing I've got against him is the color of his coat. It
      always reminds me of Reddy Fox, and I don't like anything that reminds me
      of that fellow. When he visited us I discovered something about Scratcher
      which I don't believe you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; demanded Jenny rather sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That when he scratches among the leaves he uses both feet at once,&rdquo; cried
      Peter triumphantly. &ldquo;It's funny to watch him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! I knew that,&rdquo; retorted Jenny Wren. &ldquo;What do you suppose my eyes are
      make for? I thought you were going to tell me something I didn't know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter looked disappointed.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. Chippy, Sweetvoice, and Dotty.
    </h2>
    <p>
      For a while Jenny Wren was too busy to talk save to scold Mr. Wren for
      spending so much time singing instead of working. To Peter it seemed as if
      they were trying to fill that tree trunk with rubbish. &ldquo;I should think
      they had enough stuff in there for half a dozen nests,&rdquo; muttered Peter. &ldquo;I
      do believe they are carrying it in for the fun of working.&rdquo; Peter wasn't
      far wrong in this thought, as he was to discover a little later in the
      season when he found Mr. Wren building another nest for which he had no
      use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding that for the time being he could get nothing more from Jenny Wren,
      Peter hopped over to visit Johnny Chuck, whose home was between the roots
      of an old apple-tree in the far corner of the Old Orchard. Peter was still
      thinking of the Sparrow family; what a big family it was, yet how seldom
      any of them, excepting Bully the English Sparrow, were to be found in the
      Old Orchard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Johnny Chuck!&rdquo; cried Peter, as he discovered Johnny sitting on his
      doorstep. &ldquo;You've lived in the Old Orchard a long time, so you ought to be
      able to tell me something I want to know. Why is it that none of the
      Sparrow family excepting that noisy nuisance, Bully, build in the trees of
      the Old Orchard? Is it because Bully has driven all the rest out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnny Chuck shook his head. &ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;whatever is the matter
      with your ears? And whatever is the matter with your eyes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; replied Peter rather shortly. &ldquo;They are as good as yours any
      day, Johnny Chuck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnny grinned. &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; said Johnny. Peter listened. From a tree just a
      little way off came a clear &ldquo;Chip, chip, chip, chip.&rdquo; Peter didn't need to
      be told to look. He knew without looking who was over there. He knew that
      voice for that of one of his oldest and best friends in the Old Orchard, a
      little fellow with a red-brown cap, brown back with feathers streaked with
      black, brownish wings and tail, a gray waistcoat and black bill, and a
      little white line over each eye&mdash;altogether as trim a little
      gentleman as Peter was acquainted with. It was Chippy, as everybody calls
      the Chipping Sparrow, the smallest of the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter looked a little foolish. &ldquo;I forgot all about Chippy,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Now
      I think of it, I have found Chippy here in the Old Orchard ever since I
      can remember. I never have seen his nest because I never happened to think
      about looking for it. Does he build a trashy nest like his cousin, Bully?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnny Chuck laughed. &ldquo;I should say not!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Twice Chippy and
      Mrs. Chippy have built their nest in this very old apple-tree. There is no
      trash in their nest, I can tell you! It is just as dainty as they are, and
      not a bit bigger than it has to be. It is made mostly of little fine, dry
      roots, and it is lined inside with horse-hair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; Peter's voice sounded as it he suspected that Johnny Chuck
      was trying to fool him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a fact,&rdquo; said Johnny, nodding his head gravely. &ldquo;Goodness knows
      where they find it these days, but find it they do. Here comes Chippy
      himself; ask him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chippy and Mrs. Chippy came flitting from tree to tree until they were on
      a branch right over Peter and Johnny. &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; cried Peter. &ldquo;You folks
      seem very busy. Haven't you finished building your nest yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nearly,&rdquo; replied Chippy. &ldquo;It is all done but the horsehair. We are on our
      way up to Farmer Brown's barnyard now to look for some. You haven't seen
      any around anywhere, have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter and Johnny shook their heads, and Peter confessed that he wouldn't
      know horsehair if he saw it. He often had found hair from the coats of
      Reddy Fox and Old Man Coyote and Digger the Badger and Lightfoot the Deer,
      but hair from the coat of a horse was altogether another matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't hair from the coat of a horse that we want,&rdquo; cried Chippy, as he
      prepared to fly after Mrs. Chippy. &ldquo;It is long hair form the tail or mane
      of a horse that we must have. It makes the very nicest kind of lining for
      a nest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chippy and Mrs. Chippy were gone a long time, but when they did return
      each was carrying a long black hair. They had found what they wanted, and
      Mrs. Chippy was in high spirits because, as she took pains to explain to
      Peter, that little nest would not soon be ready for the four beautiful
      little blue eggs with black spots on one end she meant to lay in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just love Chippy and Mrs. Chippy,&rdquo; said Peter, as they watched their
      two little feathered friends putting the finishing touches to the little
      nest far out on a branch of one of the apple-trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody does,&rdquo; replied Johnny. &ldquo;Everybody loves them as much as they
      hate Bully and his wife. Did you know that they are sometimes called Tree
      Sparrows? I suppose it is because they so often build their nests in
      trees?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;I didn't. Chippy shouldn't be called Tree Sparrow,
      because he has a cousin by that name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnny Chuck looked as if he doubted that, &ldquo;I never heard of him,&rdquo; he
      grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter grinned. Here was a chance to tell Johnny Chuck something, and Peter
      never is happier than when he can tell folks something they don't know.
      &ldquo;You'd know him if you didn't sleep all winter,&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;Dotty the
      Tree Sparrow spends the winter here. He left for his home in the Far North
      about the time you took it into your head to wake up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you call him Dotty?&rdquo; asked Johnny Chuck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he has a little round black dot right in the middle of his
      breast,&rdquo; replied Peter. &ldquo;I don't know why they call him Tree Sparrow; he
      doesn't spend his time in the trees the way Chippy does, but I see him
      much oftener in low bushes or on the ground. I think Chippy has much more
      right to the name of Tree Sparrow than Dotty has. Now I think of it, I've
      heard Dotty called the Winter Chippy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious, what a mix-up!&rdquo; exclaimed Johnny Chuck. &ldquo;With Chippy being
      called a Tree Sparrow and a Tree Sparrow called Chippy, I should think
      folks would get all tangled up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps they would,&rdquo; replied Peter, &ldquo;if both were here at the same time,
      but Chippy comes just as Dotty goes, and Dotty comes as Chippy goes.
      That's a pretty good arrangement, especially as they look very much alike,
      excepting that Dotty is quite a little bigger than Chippy and always has
      that black dot, which Chippy does not have. Goodness gracious, it is time
      I was back in the dear Old Briar-patch! Good-by, Johnny Chuck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Away went Peter Rabbit, lipperty-lipperty-lip, heading for the dear Old
      Briar-patch. Out of the grass just ahead of him flew a rather pale,
      streaked little brown bird, and as he spread his tail Peter saw two white
      feathers on the outer edges. Those two white feathers were all Peter
      needed to recognize another little friend of whom he is very fond. It was
      Sweetvoice the Vesper Sparrow, the only one of the Sparrow family with
      white feathers in his tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come over to the dear Old Briar-patch and sing to me,&rdquo; cried Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sweetvoice dropped down into the grass again, and when Peter came up, was
      very busy getting a mouthful of dry grass. &ldquo;Can't,&rdquo; mumbled Sweetvoice.
      &ldquo;Can't do it now, Peter Rabbit. I'm too busy. It is high time our nest was
      finished, and Mrs. Sweetvoice will lose her patience if I don't get this
      grass over there pretty quick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is your nest; in a tree?&rdquo; asked Peter innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's telling,&rdquo; declared Sweetvoice. &ldquo;Not a living soul knows where that
      nest is, excepting Mrs. Sweetvoice and myself. This much I will tell you,
      Peter: it isn't in a tree. And I'll tell you this much more: it is in a
      hoofprint of Bossy the Cow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a WHAT?&rdquo; cried Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a hoofprint of Bossy the Cow,&rdquo; repeated Sweetvoice, chuckling softly.
      &ldquo;You know when the ground was wet and soft early this spring, Bossy left
      deep footprints wherever she went. One of these makes the nicest kind of a
      place for a nest. I think we have picked out the very best one on all the
      Green Meadows. Now run along, Peter Rabbit, and don't bother me any more.
      I've got too much to do to sit here talking. Perhaps I'll come over to the
      edge of the dear Old Briar-patch and sing to you a while just after jolly,
      round, red Mr. Sun goes to bed behind the Purple Hills. I just love to
      sing then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll be watching for you,&rdquo; replied Peter. &ldquo;You don't love to sing any
      better than I love to hear you. I think that is the best time of all the
      day in which to sing. I mean, I think it's the best time to hear singing,&rdquo;
       for of course Peter himself does not sing at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night, sure enough, just as the Black Shadows came creeping out over
      the Green Meadows, Sweetvoice, perched on the top of a bramble-bush over
      Peter's head, sang over and over again the sweetest little song and kept
      on singing even after it was quite dark. Peter didn't know it, but it is
      this habit of singing in the evening which has given Sweetvoice his name
      of Vesper Sparrow.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. Peter Learns Something He Hadn't Guessed.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Running over to the Old Orchard very early in the morning for a little
      gossip with Jenny Wren and his other friends there had become a regular
      thing with Peter Rabbit. He was learning a great many things, and some of
      them were most surprising.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now two of Peter's oldest and best friends in the Old Orchard were Winsome
      Bluebird and Welcome Robin. Every spring they arrived pretty nearly
      together, though Winsome Bluebird usually was a few days ahead of Welcome
      Robin. This year Winsome had arrived while the snow still lingered in
      patches. He was, as he always is, the herald of sweet Mistress Spring. And
      when Peter had heard for the first time Winsome's soft, sweet whistle,
      which seemed to come from nowhere in particular and from everywhere in
      general, he had kicked up his long hind legs from pure joy. Then, when a
      few days later he had heard Welcome Robin's joyous message of &ldquo;Cheer-up!
      Cheer-up! Cheer-up! Cheer-up! Cheer!&rdquo; from the tiptop of a tall tree, he
      had known that Mistress Spring really had arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter loves Winsome Bluebird and Welcome Robin, just as everybody else
      does, and he had known them so long and so well that he thought he knew
      all there was to know about them. He would have been very indignant had
      anybody told him he didn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those cousins don't look much alike, do they?&rdquo; remarked Jenny Wren, as
      she poked her head out of her house to gossip with Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What cousins?&rdquo; demanded Peter, staring very hard in the direction in
      which Jenny Wren was looking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those two sitting on the fence over there. Where are your eyes, Peter?&rdquo;
       replied Jenny rather sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter stared harder than ever. On one post sat Winsome Bluebird, and on
      another post sat Welcome Robin. &ldquo;I don't see anybody but Winsome and
      Welcome, and they are not even related,&rdquo; replied Peter with a little
      puzzled frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, tut, tut, tut, tut, Peter!&rdquo; exclaimed Jenny Wren. &ldquo;Tut, tut, tut,
      tut, tut! Who told you any such nonsense as that? Of course they are
      related. They are cousins. I thought everybody knew that. They belong to
      the same family that Melody the Thrush and all the other Thrushes belong
      to. That makes them all cousins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; exclaimed Peter, looking as if he didn't believe a word of what
      Jenny Wren had said. Jenny repeated, and still Peter looked doubtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Jenny lost her temper, a thing she does very easily. &ldquo;If you don't
      believe me, go ask one of them,&rdquo; she snapped, and disappeared inside her
      house, where Peter could hear her scolding away to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more he thought of it, the more this struck Peter as good advice. So
      he hopped over to the foot of the fence post on which Winsome Bluebird was
      sitting. &ldquo;Jenny Wren says that you and Welcome Robin are cousins. She
      doesn't know what she is talking about, does she?&rdquo; asked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winsome chuckled. It was a soft, gentle chuckle. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, nodding
      his head, &ldquo;we are. You can trust that little busybody to know what she is
      talking about, every time. I sometimes think she knows more about other
      people's affairs than about her own. Welcome and I may not look much
      alike, but we are cousins just the same. Don't you think Welcome is
      looking unusually fine this spring?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit finer than you are yourself, Winsome,&rdquo; replied Peter politely.
      &ldquo;I just love that sky-blue coat of yours. What is the reason that Mrs.
      Bluebird doesn't wear as bright a coat as you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go ask Jenny Wren,&rdquo; chuckled Winsome Bluebird, and before Peter could say
      another word he flew over to the roof of Farmer Brown's house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back scampered Peter to tell Jenny Wren that he was sorry he had doubted
      her and that he never would again. Then he begged Jenny to tell him why it
      was that Mrs. Bluebird was not as brightly dressed as was Winsome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Bluebird, like most mothers, is altogether too busy to spend much
      time taking care of her clothes; and fine clothes need a lot of care,&rdquo;
       replied Jenny. &ldquo;Besides, when Winsome is about he attracts all the
      attention and that gives her a chance to slip in and out of her nest
      without being noticed. I don't believe you know, Peter Rabbit, where
      Winsome's nest is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter had to admit that he didn't, although he had tried his best to find
      out by watching Winsome. &ldquo;I think it's over in that little house put up by
      Farmer Brown's boy,&rdquo; he ventured. &ldquo;I saw both Mr. and Mrs. Bluebird go in
      it when they first came, and I've seen Winsome around it a great deal
      since, so I guess it is there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you guess it is there!&rdquo; mimicked Jenny Wren. &ldquo;Well, your guess is
      quite wrong, Peter; quite wrong. As a matter of fact, it is in one of
      those old fence posts. But just which one I am not going to tell you. I
      will leave that for you to find out. Mrs. Bluebird certainly shows good
      sense. She knows a good house when she sees it. The hole in that post is
      one of the best holes anywhere around here. If I had arrived here early
      enough I would have taken it myself. But Mrs. Bluebird already had her
      nest built in it and four eggs there, so there was nothing for me to do
      but come here. Just between you and me, Peter, I think the Bluebirds show
      more sense in nest building than do their cousins the Robins. There is
      nothing like a house with stout walls and a doorway just big enough to get
      in and out of comfortably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter nodded quite as if he understood all about the advantages of a house
      with walls. &ldquo;That reminds me,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The other day I saw Welcome Robin
      getting mud and carrying it away. Pretty soon he was joined by Mrs. Robin,
      and she did the same thing. They kept it up till I got tired of watching
      them. What were they doing with that mud?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Building their nest, of course, stupid,&rdquo; retorted Jenny. &ldquo;Welcome Robin,
      with that black head, beautiful russet breast, black and white throat and
      yellow bill, not to mention the proud way in which he carries himself,
      certainly is a handsome fellow, and Mrs. Robin is only a little less
      handsome. How they can be content to build the kind of a home they do is
      more than I can understand. People think that Mr. Wren and I use a lot of
      trash in our nest. Perhaps we do, but I can tell you one thing, and that
      is it is clean trash. It is just sticks and clean straws, and before I lay
      my eggs I see to it that my nest is lined with feathers. More than this,
      there isn't any cleaner housekeeper than I am, if I do say it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Welcome Robin is a fine looker and a fine singer, and everybody loves
      him. But when it comes to housekeeping, he and Mrs. Robin are just plain
      dirty. They make the foundation of their nest of mud,&mdash;plain, common,
      ordinary mud. They cover this with dead grass, and sometimes there is
      mighty little of this over the inside walls of mud. I know because I've
      seen the inside of their nest often. Anybody with any eyes at all can find
      their nest. More than once I've known them to have their nest washed away
      in a heavy rain, or have it blown down in a high wind. Nothing like that
      ever happens to Winsome Bluebird or to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jenny disappeared inside her house, and Peter waited for her to come out
      again. Welcome Robin flew down on the ground, ran a few steps, and then
      stood still with his head on one side as if listening. Then he reached
      down and tugged at something, and presently out of the ground came a long,
      wriggling angleworm. Welcome gulped it down and ran on a few steps, then
      once more paused to listen. This time he turned and ran three or four
      steps to the right, where he pulled another worm out of the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He acts as if he heard those worms in the ground,&rdquo; said Peter, speaking
      aloud without thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does,&rdquo; said Jenny Wren, poking her head out of her doorway just as
      Peter spoke. &ldquo;How do you suppose he would find them when they are in the
      ground if he didn't hear them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you hear them?&rdquo; asked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've never tried, and I don't intend to waste my time trying,&rdquo; retorted
      Jenny. &ldquo;Welcome Robin may enjoy eating them, but for my part I want
      something smaller and daintier, young grasshoppers, tender young beetles,
      small caterpillars, bugs and spiders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter had to turn his head aside to hide the wry face he just had to make
      at the mention of such things as food. &ldquo;Is that all Welcome Robin eats?&rdquo;
       he asked innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say not,&rdquo; laughed Jenny. &ldquo;He eats a lot of other kinds of worms,
      and he just dearly loves fruit like strawberries and cherries and all
      sorts of small berries. Well, I can't stop here talking any longer. I'm
      going to tell you a secret, Peter, if you'll promise not to tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course Peter promised, and Jenny leaned so far down that Peter wondered
      how she could keep from falling as she whispered, &ldquo;I've got seven eggs in
      my nest, so if you don't see much of me for the next week or more, you'll
      know why. I've just got to sit on those eggs and keep them warm.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VI. An Old Friend In a New Home.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Every day brought newcomers to the Old Orchard, and early in the morning
      there were so many voices to be heard that perhaps it is no wonder if for
      some time Peter Rabbit failed to miss that of one of his very good
      friends. Most unexpectedly he was reminded of this as very early one
      morning he scampered, lipperty-lipperty-lip, across a little bridge over
      the Laughing Brook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me! Dear me! Dear me!&rdquo; cried rather a plaintive voice. Peter stopped
      so suddenly that he all but fell heels over head. Sitting on the top of a
      tall, dead, mullein stalk was a very soberly dressed but rather trim
      little fellow, a very little larger than Bully the English Sparrow. Above,
      his coat was of a dull olive-brown, while underneath he was of a
      grayish-white, with faint tinges of yellow in places. His head was dark,
      and his bill black. The feathers on his head were lifted just enough to
      make the tiniest kind of crest. His wings and tail were dusky, little bars
      of white showing very faintly on his wings, while the outer edges of his
      tail were distinctly white. He sat with his tail hanging straight down, as
      if he hadn't strength enough to hold it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Dear Me!&rdquo; cried Peter joyously. &ldquo;What are you doing way down here?
      I haven't seen you since you first arrived, just after Winsome Bluebird
      got here.&rdquo; Peter started to say that he had wondered what had become of
      Dear Me, but checked himself, for Peter is very honest and he realized now
      that in the excitement of greeting so many friends he hadn't missed Dear
      Me at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Me the Phoebe did not reply at once, but darted out into the air, and
      Peter heard a sharp click of that little black bill. Making a short
      circle, Dear Me alighted on the mullein stalk again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you catch a fly then?&rdquo; asked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me! Dear me! Of course I did,&rdquo; was the prompt reply. And with each
      word there was a jerk of that long hanging tail. Peter almost wondered if
      in some way Dear Me's tongue and tail were connected. &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said
      he, &ldquo;that it is the habit of catching flies and bugs in the air that has
      given your family the name of Flycatchers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dear Me nodded and almost at once started into the air again. Once more
      Peter heard the click of that little black bill, then Dear Me was back on
      his perch. Peter asked again what he was doing down there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Phoebe and I are living down here,&rdquo; replied Dear Me. &ldquo;We've made our
      home down here and we like it very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter looked all around, this way, that way, every way, with the funniest
      expression on his face. He didn't see anything of Mrs. Phoebe and he
      didn't see any place in which he could imagine Mr. and Mrs. Phoebe
      building a nest. &ldquo;What are you looking for?&rdquo; asked Dear Me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Mrs. Phoebe and your home,&rdquo; declared Peter quite frankly. &ldquo;I didn't
      suppose you and Mrs. Phoebe ever built a nest on the ground, and I don't
      see any other place around here for one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dear Me chuckled. &ldquo;I wouldn't tell any one but you, Peter,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but
      I've known you so long that I'm going to let you into a little secret.
      Mrs. Phoebe and our home are under the very bridge you are sitting on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe it!&rdquo; cried Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Dear Me knew from the way Peter said it that he really didn't mean
      that. &ldquo;Look and see for yourself,&rdquo; said Dear Me.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Peter lay flat on his stomach and tried to stretch his head over the
      edge of the bridge so as to see under it. But his neck wasn't long enough,
      or else he was afraid to lean over as far as he might have. Finally he
      gave up and at Mr. Phoebe's suggestion crept down the bank to the very
      edge of the Laughing Brook. Dear Me darted out to catch another fly, then
      flew right in under the bridge and alighted on a little ledge of stone
      just beneath the floor. There, sure enough, was a nest, and Peter could
      see Mrs. Phoebe's bill and the top of her head above the edge of it. It
      was a nest with a foundation of mud covered with moss and lined with
      feathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's perfectly splendid!&rdquo; cried Peter, as Dear Me resumed his perch on
      the old mullein stalk. &ldquo;How did you ever come to think of such a place?
      And why did you leave the shed up at Farmer Brown's where you have build
      your home for the last two or three years?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; replied Dear Me, &ldquo;we Phoebes always have been fond of building under
      bridges. You see a place like this is quite safe. Then, too, we like to be
      near water. Always there are many insects flying around where there is
      water, so it is an easy matter to get plenty to eat. I left the shed at
      Farmer Brown's because that pesky cat up there discovered our nest last
      year, and we had a dreadful time keeping our babies out of her clutches.
      She hasn't found us down here, and she wouldn't be able to trouble us if
      she should find us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;that as usual you were the first of your family
      to arrive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. Of course,&rdquo; replied Dear Me. &ldquo;We always are the first. Mrs.
      Phoebe and I don't go as far south in winter as the other members of the
      family do. They go clear down into the Tropics, but we manage to pick up a
      pretty good living without going as far as that. So we get back here
      before the rest of them, and usually have begun housekeeping by the time
      they arrive. My cousin, Chebec the Least Flycatcher, should be here by
      this time. Haven't you heard anything of him up in the Old Orchard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Peter, &ldquo;but to tell the truth I haven't looked for him. I'm
      on my way to the Old Orchard now, and I certainly shall keep my ears and
      eyes open for Chebec. I'll tell you if I find him. Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me! Dear me! Good-by Peter. Dear me!&rdquo; replied Mr. Phoebe as Peter
      started off for the Old Orchard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it was because Peter was thinking of him that almost the first
      voice he heard when he reached the Old Orchard was that of Chebec,
      repeating his own name over and over as if he loved the sound of it. It
      didn't take Peter long to find him. He was sitting out on the up of one of
      the upper branches of an apple-tree where he could watch for flies and
      other winged insects. He looked so much like Mr. Phoebe, save that he was
      smaller, that any one would have know they were cousins. &ldquo;Chebec! Chebec!
      Chebec!&rdquo; he repeated over and over, and with every note jerked his tail.
      Now and then he would dart out into the air and snap up something so small
      that Peter, looking up from the ground, couldn't see it at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Chebec!&rdquo; cried Peter. &ldquo;I'm glad to see you back again. Are you
      going to build in the Old Orchard this year?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I am,&rdquo; replied Chebec promptly. &ldquo;Mrs. Chebec and I have built
      here for the last two or three years, and we wouldn't think of going
      anywhere else. Mrs. Chebec is looking for a place now. I suppose I ought
      to be helping her, but I learned a long time ago, Peter Rabbit, that in
      matters of this kind it is just as well not to have any opinion at all.
      When Mrs. Chebec has picked out just the place she wants, I'll help her
      build the nest. It certainly is good to be back here in the Old Orchard
      and planning a home once more. We've made a terribly long journey, and I
      for one am glad it's over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just saw your cousins, Mr. and Mrs. Phoebe, and they already have a
      nest and eggs,&rdquo; said Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Phoebes are a funny lot,&rdquo; replied Chebec. &ldquo;They are the only members
      of the family that can stand cold weather. What pleasure they get out of
      it I don't understand. They are queer anyway, for they never build their
      nests in trees as the rest of us do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you the smallest in the family?&rdquo; asked Peter, for it had suddenly
      struck him that Chebec was a very little fellow indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chebec nodded. &ldquo;I'm the smallest,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;That's why they call me Least
      Flycatcher. I may be least in size, but I can tell you one thing, Peter
      Rabbit, and that is that I can catch just as many bugs and flies as any of
      them.&rdquo; Suiting action to the word, he darted out into the air. His little
      bill snapped and with a quick turn he was back on his former perch,
      jerking his tail and uttering his sharp little cry of, &ldquo;Chebec! Chebec!
      Chebec!&rdquo; until Peter began to wonder which he was the most fond of,
      catching flies, or the sound of his own voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently they both heard Mrs. Chebec calling from somewhere in the middle
      of the Old Orchard. &ldquo;Excuse me, Peter,&rdquo; said Chebec, &ldquo;I must go at once.
      Mrs. Chebec says she has found just the place for our nest, and now we've
      got a busy time ahead of us. We are very particular how we build a nest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you start it with mud the way Welcome Robin and your cousins, the
      Phoebes, do?&rdquo; asked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mud!&rdquo; cried Chebec scornfully. &ldquo;Mud! I should say not! I would have you
      understand, Peter, that we are very particular about what we use in our
      nest. We use only the finest of rootlets, strips of soft bark, fibers of
      plants, the brown cotton that grows on ferns, and perhaps a little hair
      when we can find it. We make a dainty nest, if I do say it, and we fasten
      it securely in the fork made by two or three upright little branches. Now
      I must go because Mrs. Chebec is getting impatient. Come see me when I'm
      not so busy Peter.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. The Watchman of the Old Orchard.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A few days after Chebec and his wife started building their nest in the
      Old Orchard Peter dropped around as usual for a very early call. He found
      Chebec very busy hunting for materials for that nest, because, as he
      explained to Peter, Mrs. Chebec is very particular indeed about what her
      nest is made of. But he had time to tell Peter a bit of news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My fighting cousin and my handsomest cousin arrived together yesterday,
      and now our family is very well represented in the Old Orchard,&rdquo; said
      Chebec proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly Peter reached over his back with his long left hind foot and
      thoughtfully scratched his long right ear. He didn't like to admit that he
      couldn't recall those two cousins of Chebec's. &ldquo;Did you say your fighting
      cousin?&rdquo; he asked in a hesitating way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what I said,&rdquo; replied Chebec. &ldquo;He is Scrapper the Kingbird, as of
      course you know. The rest of us always feel safe when he is about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I know him,&rdquo; declared Peter, his face clearing. &ldquo;Where is he
      now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that very instant a great racket broke out on the other side of the Old
      Orchard and in no time at all the feathered folks were hurrying from every
      direction, screaming at the top of their voices. Of course, Peter couldn't
      be left out of anything like that, and he scampered for the scene of
      trouble as fast as his legs could take him. When he got there he saw
      Redtail the Hawk flying up and down and this way and that way, as if
      trying to get away from something or somebody.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a minute Peter couldn't think what was the trouble with Redtail, and
      then he saw. A white-throated, white-breasted bird, having a black cap and
      back, and a broad white band across the end of his tail, was darting at
      Redtail as if he meant to pull out every feather in the latter's coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was just a little smaller than Welcome Robin, and in comparison with
      him Redtail was a perfect giant. But this seemed to make no difference to
      Scrapper, for that is who it was. He wasn't afraid, and he intended that
      everybody should know it, especially Redtail. It is because of his
      fearlessness that he is called Kingbird. All the time he was screaming at
      the top of his lungs, calling Redtail a robber and every other bad name he
      could think of. All the other birds joined him in calling Redtail bad
      names. But none, not even Bully the English Sparrow, was brave enough to
      join him in attacking big Redtail.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had succeeded in driving Redtail far enough from the Old Orchard
      to suit him, Scrapper flew back and perched on a dead branch of one of the
      trees, where he received the congratulations of all his feathered
      neighbors. He took them quite modestly, assuring them that he had done
      nothing, nothing at all, but that he didn't intend to have any of the Hawk
      family around the Old Orchard while he lived there. Peter couldn't help
      but admire Scrapper for his courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Peter looked up at Scrapper he saw that, like all the rest of the
      flycatchers, there was just the tiniest of hooks on the end of his bill.
      Scrapper's slightly raised cap seemed all black, but if Peter could have
      gotten close enough, he would have found that hidden in it was a patch of
      orange-red. While Peter sat staring up at him Scrapper suddenly darted out
      into the air, and his bill snapped in quite the same way Chebec's did when
      he caught a fly. But it wasn't a fly that Scrapper had. It was a bee.
      Peter saw it very distinctly just as Scrapper snapped it up. It reminded
      Peter that he had often heard Scrapper called the Bee Martin, and now he
      understood why.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you live on bees altogether?&rdquo; asked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless your heart, Peter, no,&rdquo; replied Scrapper with a chuckle. &ldquo;There
      wouldn't be any honey if I did. I like bees. I like them first rate. But
      they form only a very small part of my food. Those that I do catch are
      mostly drones, and you know the drones are useless. They do no work at
      all. It is only by accident that I now and then catch a worker. I eat all
      kinds of insects that fly and some that don't. I'm one of Farmer Brown's
      best friends, if he did but know it. You can talk all you please about the
      wonderful eyesight of the members of the Hawk family, but if any one of
      them has better eyesight than I have, I'd like to know who it is. There's
      a fly 'way over there beyond that old apple-tree; watch me catch it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter knew better than to waste any effort trying to see that fly. He knew
      that he couldn't have seen it had it been only one fourth that distance
      away. But if he couldn't see the fly he could hear the sharp click of
      Scrapper's bill, and he knew by the way Scrapper kept opening and shutting
      his mouth after his return that he had caught that fly and it had tasted
      good.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to build in the Old Orchard this year?&rdquo; asked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I am,&rdquo; declared Scrapper. &ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then he spied Blacky the Crow and dashed out to meet him. Blacky saw
      him coming and was wise enough to suddenly appear to have no interest
      whatever in the Old Orchard, turning away toward the Green Meadows
      instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter didn't wait for Scrapper to return. It was getting high time for him
      to scamper home to the dear Old Briar-patch and so he started along,
      lipperty-lipperty-lip. Just as he was leaving the far corner of the Old
      Orchard some one called him. &ldquo;Peter! Oh, Peter Rabbit!&rdquo; called the voice.
      Peter stopped abruptly, sat up very straight, looked this way, looked that
      way and looked the other way, every way but the right way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look up over your head,&rdquo; cried the voice, rather a harsh voice. Peter
      looked, then all in a flash it came to him who it was Chebec had meant by
      the handsomest member of his family. It was Cresty the Great Crested
      Flycatcher. He was a wee bit bigger than Scrapper the Kingbird, yet not
      quite so big as Welcome Robin, and more slender. His throat and breast
      were gray, shading into bright yellow underneath. His back and head were
      of a grayish-brown with a tint of olive-green. A pointed cap was all that
      was needed to make him quite distinguished looking. He certainly was the
      handsomest as well as the largest of the Flycatcher family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to be in a hurry, so don't let me detain you, Peter,&rdquo; said
      Cresty, before Peter could find his tongue. &ldquo;I just want to ask one little
      favor of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Peter, who is always glad to do any one a favor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If in your roaming about you run across an old cast-off suit of Mr. Black
      Snake, or of any other member of the Snake family, I wish you would
      remember me and let me know. Will you, Peter?&rdquo; said Cresty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;what?&rdquo; stammered Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A cast-off suit of clothes from any member of the Snake family,&rdquo; replied
      Cresty somewhat impatiently. &ldquo;Now don't forget, Peter. I've got to go
      house hunting, but you'll find me there or hereabouts, if it happens that
      you find one of those cast-off Snake suits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before Peter could say another word Cresty had flown away. Peter
      hesitated, looking first towards the dear Old Briar-patch and then towards
      Jenny Wren's house. He just couldn't understand about those cast-off suits
      of the Snake family, and he felt sure that Jenny Wren could tell him.
      Finally curiosity got the best of him, and back he scampered,
      lipperty-lipperty-lip, to the foot of the tree in which Jenny Wren had her
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jenny!&rdquo; called Peter. &ldquo;Jenny Wren! Jenny Wren!&rdquo; No one answered him. He
      could hear Mr. Wren singing in another tree, but he couldn't see him.
      &ldquo;Jenny! Jenny Wren! Jenny Wren!&rdquo; called Peter again. This time Jenny
      popped her head out, and her little eyes fairly snapped. &ldquo;Didn't I tell
      you the other day, Peter Rabbit, that I'm not to be disturbed? Didn't I
      tell you that I've got seven eggs in here, and that I can't spend any time
      gossiping? Didn't I, Peter Rabbit? Didn't I? Didn't I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You certainly did, Jenny. You certainly did, and I'm sorry to disturb
      you,&rdquo; replied Peter meekly. &ldquo;I wouldn't have thought of doing such a
      thing, but I just didn't know who else to go to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to for what?&rdquo; snapped Jenny Wren. &ldquo;What is it you've come to me for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Snake skins,&rdquo; replied Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Snake skins! Snake skins!&rdquo; shrieked Jenny Wren. &ldquo;What are you talking
      about, Peter Rabbit? I never have anything to do with Snake skins and
      don't want to. Ugh! It makes me shiver just to think of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't understand,&rdquo; cried Peter hurriedly. &ldquo;What I want to know is,
      why should Cresty the Flycatcher ask me to please let him know if I found
      any cast-off suits of the Snake family? He flew away before I could ask
      him why he wants them, and so I came to you, because I know you know
      everything, especially everything concerning your neighbors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jenny Wren looked as if she didn't know whether to feel flattered or
      provoked. But Peter looked so innocent that she concluded he was trying to
      say something nice.

      CHAPTER VIII. Old Clothes and Old Houses.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't stop to talk to you any longer now, Peter Rabbit,&rdquo; said Jenny
      Wren, &ldquo;but if you will come over here bright and early to-morrow morning,
      while I am out to get my breakfast, I will tell you about Cresty the
      Flycatcher and why he wants the cast-off clothes of some of the Snake
      family. Perhaps I should say WHAT he wants of them instead of WHY he wants
      them, for why any one should want anything to do with Snakes is more then
      I can understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this Jenny Wren disappeared inside her house, and there was nothing
      for Peter to do but once more start for the dear Old Briar-patch. On his
      way he couldn't resist the temptation to run over to the Green Forest,
      which was just beyond the Old Orchard. He just HAD to find out if there
      was anything new over there. Hardly had he reached it when he heard a
      plaintive voice crying, &ldquo;Pee-wee! Pee-wee! Pee-wee!&rdquo; Peter chuckled
      happily. &ldquo;I declare, there's Pee-wee,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;He usually is one of the
      last of the Flycatcher family to arrive. I didn't expect to find him yet.
      I wonder what has brought him up so early.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It didn't take Peter long to find Pewee. He just followed the sound of
      that voice and presently saw Pewee fly out and make the same kind of a
      little circle as the other members of the family make when they are
      hunting flies. It ended just where it had started, on a dead twig of a
      tree in a shady, rather lonely part of the Green Forest. Almost at once he
      began to call his name in a rather sad, plaintive tone, &ldquo;Pee-wee! Pee-wee!
      Pee-wee!&rdquo; But he wasn't sad, as Peter well knew. It was his way of
      expressing how happy he felt. He was a little bigger than his cousin,
      Chebec, but looked very much like him. There was a little notch in the end
      of his tail. The upper half of his bill was black, but the lower half was
      light. Peter could see on each wing two whitish bars, and he noticed that
      Pewee's wings were longer than his tail, which wasn't the case with
      Chebec. But no one could ever mistake Pewee for any of his relatives, for
      the simple reason that he keeps repeating his own name over and over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't you here early?&rdquo; asked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pewee nodded. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It has been unusually warm this spring, so
      I hurried a little and came up with my cousins, Scrapper and Cresty. That
      is something I don't often do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please,&rdquo; Peter inquired politely, &ldquo;why do folks call you Wood
      Pewee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pewee chuckled happily. &ldquo;It must be,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;because I am so very fond
      of the Green Forest. It is so quiet and restful that I love it. Mrs. Pewee
      and I are very retiring. We do not like too many near neighbors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won't mind if I come to see you once in a while, will you?&rdquo; asked
      Peter as he prepared to start on again for the dear Old Briar-patch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come as often as you like,&rdquo; replied Pewee. &ldquo;The oftener the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Back in the Old Briar-patch Peter thought over all he had learned about
      the Flycatcher family, and as he recalled how they were forever catching
      all sorts of flying insects it suddenly struck him that they must be very
      useful little people in helping Old Mother Nature take care of her trees
      and other growing things which insects so dearly love to destroy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But most of all Peter thought about that queer request of Cresty's, and a
      dozen times that day he found himself peeping under old logs in the hope
      of finding a cast-off coat of Mr. Black Snake. It was such a funny thing
      for Cresty to ask for that Peter's curiosity would allow him no peace, and
      the next morning he was up in the Old Orchard before jolly Mr. Sun had
      kicked his bedclothes off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jenny Wren was as good as her word. While she flitted and hopped about
      this way and that way in that fussy way of hers, getting her breakfast,
      she talked. Jenny couldn't keep her tongue still if she wanted to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you find any old clothes of the Snake family?&rdquo; she demanded. Then as
      Peter shook his head her tongue ran on without waiting for him to reply.
      &ldquo;Cresty and his wife always insist upon having a piece of Snake skin in
      their nest,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Why they want it, goodness knows! But they do want
      it and never can seem to settle down to housekeeping unless they have it.
      Perhaps they think it will scare robbers away. As for me, I should have a
      cold chill every time I got into my nest if I had to sit on anything like
      that. I have to admit that Cresty and his wife are a handsome couple, and
      they certainly have good sense in choosing a house, more sense than any
      other member of their family to my way of thinking. But Snake skins! Ugh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, where does Cresty build?&rdquo; asked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a hole in a tree, like the rest of us sensible people,&rdquo; retorted Jenny
      Wren promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter looked quite as surprised as he felt. &ldquo;Does Cresty make the hole?&rdquo;
       he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness gracious, no!&rdquo; exclaimed Jenny Wren. &ldquo;Where are your eyes,
      Peter? Did you ever see a Flycatcher with a bill that looked as if it
      could cut wood?&rdquo; She didn't wait for a reply, but rattled on. &ldquo;It is a
      good thing for a lot of us that the Woodpecker family are so fond of new
      houses. Look! There is Downy the Woodpecker hard at work on a new house
      this very minute. That's good. I like to see that. It means that next year
      there will be one more house for some one here in the Old Orchard. For
      myself I prefer old houses. I've noticed there are a number of my
      neighbors who feel the same way about it. There is something settled about
      an old house. It doesn't attract attention the way a new one does. So long
      as it has got reasonably good walls, and the rain and the wind can't get
      in, the older it is the better it suits me. But the Woodpeckers seem to
      like new houses best, which, as I said before, is a very good thing for
      the rest of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is there besides you and Cresty and Bully the English Sparrow who
      uses these old Woodpecker houses?&rdquo; asked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Winsome Bluebird, stupid!&rdquo; snapped Jenny Wren.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter grinned and looked foolish. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I forgot all
      about Winsome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Skimmer the Tree Swallow,&rdquo; added Jenny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so; I ought to have remembered him,&rdquo; exclaimed Peter. &ldquo;I've
      noticed that he is very fond of the same house year after year. Is there
      anybody else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Jenny Wren nodded. &ldquo;Yank-Yank the Nuthatch uses an old house, I'm
      told, but he usually goes up North for his nesting,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Tommy Tit
      the Chickadee sometimes uses an old house. Then again he and Mrs.
      Chickadee get fussy and make a house for themselves. Yellow Wing the
      flicker, who really is a Woodpecker, often uses an old house, but quite
      often makes a new one. Then there are Killy the Sparrow Hawk and Spooky
      the Screech Owl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter looked surprised. &ldquo;I didn't suppose THEY nested in holes in trees!&rdquo;
       he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They certainly do, more's the pity!&rdquo; snapped Jenny. &ldquo;It would be a good
      thing for the rest of us if they didn't nest at all. But they do, and an
      old house of Yellow Wing the Flicker suits either of them. Killy always
      uses one that is high up, and comes back to it year after year. Spooky
      isn't particular so long as the house is big enough to be comfortable. He
      lives in it more or less the year around. Now I must get back to those
      eggs of mine. I've talked quite enough for one morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Jenny,&rdquo; cried Peter, as a sudden thought struck him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jenny paused and jerked her tail impatiently. &ldquo;Well, what is it now?&rdquo; she
      demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got two homes?&rdquo; asked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness gracious, no!&rdquo; exclaimed Jenny. &ldquo;What do you suppose I want of
      two homes? One is all I can take care of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why,&rdquo; demanded Peter triumphantly, &ldquo;does Mr. Wren work all day
      carrying sticks and straws into a hole in another tree? It seems to me
      that he has carried enough in there to build two or three nests.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jenny Wren's eyes twinkled, and she laughed softly. &ldquo;Mr. Wren just has to
      be busy about something, bless his heart,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;He hasn't a lazy
      feather on him. He's building that nest to take up his time and keep out
      of mischief. Besides, if he fills that hollow up nobody else will take it,
      and you know we might want to move some time. Good-by, Peter.&rdquo; With a
      final jerk of her tail Jenny Wren flew to the little round doorway of her
      house and popped inside.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. Longbill and Teeter.
    </h2>
    <p>
      From the decided way in which Jenny Wren had popped into the little round
      doorway of her home, Peter knew that to wait in the hope of more gossip
      with her would be a waste of time. He wasn't ready to go back home to the
      dear Old Briar-patch, yet there seemed nothing else to do, for everybody
      in the Old Orchard was too busy for idle gossip. Peter scratched a long
      ear with a long hind foot, trying to think of some place to go. Just then
      he heard the clear &ldquo;peep, peep, peep&rdquo; of the Hylas, the sweet singers of
      the Smiling Pool.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's where I'll go!&rdquo; exclaimed Peter. &ldquo;I haven't been to the Smiling
      Pool for some time. I'll just run over and pay my respects to Grandfather
      Frog, and to Redwing the Blackbird. Redwing was one of the first birds to
      arrive, and I've neglected him shamefully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Peter thinks of something to do he wastes no time. Off he started,
      lipperty-lipperty-lip, for the Smiling Pool. He kept close to the edge of
      the Green Forest until he reached the place where the Laughing Brook comes
      out of the Green Forest on its way to the Smiling Pool in the Green
      Meadows. Bushes and young trees grow along the banks of the Laughing Brook
      at this point. The ground was soft in places, quite muddy. Peter doesn't
      mind getting his feet damp, so he hopped along carelessly. From right
      under his very nose something shot up into the air with a whistling sound.
      It startled Peter so that he stopped short with his eyes popping out of
      his head. He had just a glimpse of a brown form disappearing over the tops
      of some tall bushes. Then Peter chuckled. &ldquo;I declare,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I had
      forgotten all about my old friend, Longbill the Woodcock. He scared me for
      a second.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are even,&rdquo; said a voice close at hand. &ldquo;You scared him. I saw
      you coming, but Longbill didn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter turned quickly. There was Mrs. Woodcock peeping at him from behind a
      tussock of grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't mean to scare him,&rdquo; apologized Peter. &ldquo;I really didn't mean to.
      Do you think he was really very much scared?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not too scared to come back, anyway,&rdquo; said Longbill himself, dropping
      down just in front of Peter. &ldquo;I recognized you just as I was disappearing
      over the tops of the bushes, so I came right back. I learned when I was
      very young that when startled it is best to fly first and find out
      afterwards whether or not there is real danger. I am glad it is no one but
      you, Peter, for I was having a splendid meal here, and I should have hated
      to leave it. You'll excuse me while I go on eating, I hope. We can talk
      between bites.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly I'll excuse you,&rdquo; replied Peter, staring around very hard to
      see what it could be Longbill was making such a good meal of. But Peter
      couldn't see a thing that looked good to eat. There wasn't even a bug or a
      worm crawling on the ground. Longbill took two or three steps in rather a
      stately fashion. Peter had to hide a smile, for Longbill had such an air
      of importance, yet at the same time was such an odd looking fellow. He was
      quite a little bigger than Welcome Robin, his tail was short, his legs
      were short, and his neck was short. But his bill was long enough to make
      up. His back was a mixture of gray, brown, black and buff, while his
      breast and under parts were a beautiful reddish-buff. It was his head that
      made him look queer. His eyes were very big and they were set so far back
      that Peter wondered if it wasn't easier for him to look behind him than in
      front of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Longbill plunged his bill into the ground. He plunged it in for
      the whole length. Then he pulled it out and Peter caught a glimpse of the
      tail end of a worm disappearing down Longbill's throat. Where that long
      bill had gone into the ground was a neat little round hole. For the first
      time Peter noticed that there were many such little round holes all about.
      &ldquo;Did you make all those little round holes?&rdquo; exclaimed Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; replied Longbill. &ldquo;Mrs. Woodcock made some of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And was there a worm in every one?&rdquo; asked Peter, his eyes very wide with
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Longbill nodded. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You don't suppose we would take
      the trouble to bore one of them if we didn't know that we would get a worm
      at the end of it, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter remembered how he had watched Welcome Robin listen and then suddenly
      plunge his bill into the ground and pull out a worm. But the worms Welcome
      Robin got were always close to the surface, while these worms were so deep
      in the earth that Peter couldn't understand how it was possible for any
      one to know that they were there. Welcome Robin could see when he got hold
      of a worm, but Longbill couldn't. &ldquo;Even if you know there is a worm down
      there in the ground, how do you know when you've reached him? And how is
      it possible for you to open your bill down there to take him in?&rdquo; asked
      Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Longbill chuckled. &ldquo;That's easy,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I've got the handiest bill
      that ever was. See here!&rdquo; Longbill suddenly thrust his bill straight out
      in front of him and to Peter's astonishment he lifted the end of the upper
      half without opening the rest of his bill at all. &ldquo;That's the way I get
      them,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I can feel them when I reach them, and then I just open
      the top of my bill and grab them. I think there is one right under my feet
      now; watch me get him.&rdquo; Longbill bored into the ground until his head was
      almost against it. When he pulled his bill out, sure enough, there was a
      worm. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; explained Longbill, &ldquo;it is only in soft ground that I
      can do this. That is why I have to fly away south as soon as the ground
      freezes at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's wonderful,&rdquo; sighed Peter. &ldquo;I don't suppose any one else can find
      hidden worms that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My cousin, Jack Snipe, can,&rdquo; replied Longbill promptly. &ldquo;He feeds the
      same way I do, only he likes marshy meadows instead of brushy swamps.
      Perhaps you know him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter nodded. &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Now you speak of it, there is a strong
      family resemblance, although I hadn't thought of him as a relative of
      yours before. Now I must be running along. I'm ever so glad to have seen
      you, and I'm coming over to call again the first chance I get.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Peter said good-by and kept on down the Laughing Brook to the Smiling
      Pool. Right where the Laughing Brook entered the Smiling Pool there was a
      little pebbly beach. Running along the very edge of the water was a slim,
      trim little bird with fairly long legs, a long slender bill, brownish-gray
      back with black spots and markings, and a white waistcoat neatly spotted
      with black. Every few steps he would stop to pick up something, then stand
      for a second bobbing up and down in the funniest way, as if his body was
      so nicely balanced on his legs that it teetered back and forth like a
      seesaw. It was Teeter the Spotted Sandpiper, an old friend of Peter's.
      Peter greeted him joyously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peet-weet! Peet-weet!&rdquo; cried Teeter, turning towards Peter and bobbing
      and bowing as only Teeter can. Before Peter could say another word Teeter
      came running towards him, and it was plain to see that Teeter was very
      anxious about something. &ldquo;Don't move, Peter Rabbit! Don't move!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; demanded Peter, for he could see no danger and could think of
      no reason why he shouldn't move. Just then Mrs. Teeter came hurrying up
      and squatted down in the sand right in front of Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank goodness!&rdquo; exclaimed Teeter, still bobbing and bowing. &ldquo;If you had
      taken another step, Peter Rabbit, you would have stepped right on our
      eggs. You gave me a dreadful start.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter was puzzled. He showed it as he stared down at Mrs. Teeter just in
      front of him. &ldquo;I don't see any nest or eggs or anything,&rdquo; said he rather
      testily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Teeter stood up and stepped aside. Then Peter saw right in a little
      hollow in the sand, with just a few bits of grass for a lining, four white
      eggs with big dark blotches on them. They looked so much like the
      surrounding pebbles that he never would have seen them in the world but
      for Mrs. Teeter. Peter hastily backed away a few steps. Mrs. Teeter
      slipped back on the eggs and settled herself comfortably. It suddenly
      struck Peter that if he hadn't seen her do it, he wouldn't have known she
      was there. You see she looked so much like her surroundings that he never
      would have noticed her at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I certainly would have stepped on those eggs if you
      hadn't warned me,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I'm so thankful I didn't. I don't see how you
      dare lay them in the open like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Teeter chuckled softly. &ldquo;It's the safest place in the world, Peter,&rdquo;
       said she. &ldquo;They look so much like these pebbles around here that no one
      sees them. The only time they are in danger is when somebody comes along,
      as you did, and is likely to step on them without seeing them. But that
      doesn't happen often.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. Redwing and Yellow Wing.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Peter had come over to the Smiling Pool especially to pay his respects to
      Redwing the Blackbird, so as soon as he could, without being impolite, he
      left Mrs. Teeter sitting on her eggs, and Teeter himself bobbing and
      bowing in the friendliest way, and hurried over to where the bulrushes
      grow. In the very top of the Big Hickory-tree, a little farther along on
      the bank of the Smiling Pool, sat some one who at that distance appeared
      to be dressed all in black. He was singing as if there were nothing but
      joy in all the great world. &ldquo;Quong-ka-reee! Quong-ka-reee! Quong-ka-reee!&rdquo;
       he sang. Peter would have known from this song alone that it was Redwing
      the Blackbird, for there is no other song quite like it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Peter appeared in sight Redwing left his high perch and flew
      down to light among the broken-down bulrushes. As he flew, Peter saw the
      beautiful red patch on the bend of each wing, from which Redwing gets his
      name. &ldquo;No one could ever mistake him for anybody else,&rdquo; thought Peter,
      &ldquo;For there isn't anybody else with such beautiful shoulder patches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the news, Peter Rabbit?&rdquo; cried Redwing, coming over to sit very
      near Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn't much,&rdquo; replied Peter, &ldquo;excepting that Teeter the Sandpiper
      has four eggs just a little way from here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Redwing chuckled. &ldquo;That is no news, Peter,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Do you suppose that
      I live neighbor to Teeter and don't know where his nest is and all about
      his affairs? There isn't much going on around the Smiling Pool that I
      don't know, I can tell you that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter looked a little disappointed, because there is nothing he likes
      better than to be the bearer of news. &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said he politely, &ldquo;that
      you will be building a nest pretty soon yourself, Redwing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Redwing chuckled softly. It was a happy, contented sort of chuckle. &ldquo;No,
      Peter,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I am not going to build a nest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; exclaimed Peter, and his two long ears stood straight up with
      astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Redwing, still chuckling. &ldquo;I'm not going to build a nest,
      and if you want to know a little secret, we have four as pretty eggs as
      ever were laid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter fairly bubbled over with interest and curiosity. &ldquo;How splendid!&rdquo; he
      cried. &ldquo;Where is your nest, Redwing? I would just love to see it. I
      suppose it is because she is sitting on those eggs that I haven't seen
      Mrs. Redwing. It was very stupid of me not to guess that folks who come as
      early as you do would be among the first to build a home. Where is it,
      Redwing? Do tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Redwing's eyes twinkled.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;A secret which is known by three
      Full soon will not a secret be,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      said he. &ldquo;It isn't that I don't trust you, Peter. I know that you wouldn't
      intentionally let my secret slip out. But you might do it by accident.
      What you don't know, you can't tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right, Redwing. I am glad you have so much sense,&rdquo; said another
      voice, and Mrs. Redwing alighted very near to Redwing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter couldn't help thinking that Old Mother Nature had been very unfair
      indeed in dressing Mrs. Redwing. She was, if anything, a little bit
      smaller than her handsome husband, and such a plain, not to say homely,
      little body that it was hard work to realize that she was a Blackbird at
      all. In the first place she wasn't black. She was dressed all over in
      grayish-brown with streaks of darker brown which in places were almost
      black. She wore no bright-colored shoulder patches. In fact, there wasn't
      a bright feather on her anywhere. Peter wanted to ask why it was that she
      was so plainly dressed, but he was too polite and decided to wait until he
      should see Jenny Wren. She would be sure to know. Instead, he exclaimed,
      &ldquo;How do you do, Mrs. Redwing? I'm ever so glad to see you. I was wondering
      where you were. Where did you come from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Straight from my home,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Redwing demurely. &ldquo;And if I do say
      it, it is the best home we've ever had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Redwing chuckled. He was full of chuckles. You see, he had noticed how
      eagerly Peter was looking everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This much I will tell you, Peter,&rdquo; said Redwing; &ldquo;our nest is somewhere
      in these bulrushes, and if you can find it we won't say a word, even if
      you don't keep the secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Redwing chuckled again and Mrs. Redwing chuckled with him. You see,
      they knew that Peter doesn't like water, and that nest was hidden in a
      certain clump of brown, broken-down rushes, with water all around.
      Suddenly Redwing flew up in the air with a harsh cry. &ldquo;Run, Peter! Run!&rdquo;
       he screamed. &ldquo;Here comes Reddy Fox!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter didn't wait for a second warning. He knew by the sound of Redwing's
      voice that Redwing wasn't joking. There was just one place of safety, and
      that was an old hole of Grandfather Chuck's between the roots of the Big
      Hickory-tree. Peter didn't waste any time getting there, and he was none
      too soon, for Reddy was so close at his heels that he pulled some white
      hairs out of Peter's tail as Peter plunged headfirst down that hole. It
      was a lucky thing for Peter that that hole was too small for Reddy to
      follow and the roots prevented Reddy from digging it any bigger.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time Peter sat in Grandfather Chuck's old house, wondering how
      soon it would be safe for him to come out. For a while he heard Mr. and
      Mrs. Redwing scolding sharply, and by this he knew that Reddy Fox was
      still about. By and by they stopped scolding, and a few minutes later he
      heard Redwing's happy song. &ldquo;That means,&rdquo; thought Peter, &ldquo;that Reddy Fox
      has gone away, but I think I'll sit here a while longer to make sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now Peter was sitting right under the Big Hickory-tree. After a while he
      began to hear faint little sounds, little taps, and scratching sounds as
      of claws. They seemed to come from right over his head, but he knew that
      there was no one in that hole but himself. He couldn't understand it at
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally Peter decided it would be safe to peek outside. Very carefully he
      poked his head out. Just as he did so, a little chip struck him right on
      the nose. Peter pulled his head back hurriedly and stared at the little
      chip which lay just in front of the hole. Then two or three more little
      chips fell. Peter knew that they must come from up in the Big
      Hickory-tree, and right away his curiosity was aroused. Redwing was
      singing so happily that Peter felt sure no danger was near, so he hopped
      outside and looked up to find out where those little chips had come from.
      Just a few feet above his head he saw a round hole in the trunk of the Big
      Hickory-tree. While he was looking at it, a head with a long stout bill
      was thrust out and in that bill were two or three little chips. Peter's
      heart gave a little jump of glad surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yellow Wing!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;My goodness, how you startled me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chips were dropped and the head was thrust farther out. The sides and
      throat were a soft reddish-tan and on each side at the beginning of the
      bill was a black patch. The top of the head was gray and just at the back
      was a little band of bright red. There was no mistaking that head. It
      belonged to Yellow Wing the Flicker beyond a doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Peter!&rdquo; exclaimed Yellow Wing, his eyes twinkling. &ldquo;What are you
      doing here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; replied Peter, &ldquo;but I want to know what you are doing. What are
      all those chips?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm fixing up this old house of mine,&rdquo; replied Yellow Wing promptly. &ldquo;It
      wasn't quite deep enough to suit me, so I am making it a little deeper.
      Mrs. Yellow Wing and I haven't been able to find another house to suit us,
      so we have decided to live here again this year.&rdquo; He came wholly out and
      flew down on the ground near Peter. When his wings were spread, Peter saw
      that on the under sides they were a beautiful golden-yellow, as were the
      under sides of his tail feathers. Around his throat was a broad, black
      collar. From this, clear to his tail, were black dots. When his wings were
      spread, the upper part of his body just above the tail was pure white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My,&rdquo; exclaimed Peter, &ldquo;you are a handsome fellow! I never realized before
      how handsome you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yellow Wing looked pleased. Perhaps he felt a little flattered. &ldquo;I am glad
      you think so, Peter,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I am rather proud of my suit, myself. I
      don't know of any member of my family with whom I would change coats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sudden thought struck Peter. &ldquo;What family do you belong to?&rdquo; He asked
      abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Woodpecker family,&rdquo; replied Yellow Wing proudly.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI. Drummers and Carpenters.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Peter Rabbit was so full of questions that he hardly knew which one to ask
      first. But Yellow Wing the Flicker didn't give him a chance to ask any.
      From the edge of the Green forest there came a clear, loud call of,
      &ldquo;Pe-ok! Pe-ok! Pe-ok!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, Peter, there's Mrs. Yellow Wing calling me,&rdquo; exclaimed Yellow
      Wing, and away he went. Peter noticed that as he flew he went up and down.
      It seemed very much as if he bounded through the air just as Peter bounds
      over the ground. &ldquo;I would know him by the way he flies just as far as I
      could see him,&rdquo; thought Peter, as he started for home in the dear Old
      Briar-patch. &ldquo;Somehow he doesn't seem like a Woodpecker because he is on
      the ground so much. I must ask Jenny Wren about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was two or three days before Peter had a chance for a bit of gossip
      with Jenny Wren. When he did the first thing he asked was if Yellow Wing
      is a true Woodpecker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly he is,&rdquo; replied Jenny Wren. &ldquo;Of course he is. Why under the sun
      should you think he isn't?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it seems to me he is on the ground more than he's in the trees,&rdquo;
       retorted Peter. &ldquo;I don't know any other Woodpeckers who come down on the
      ground at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, tut, tut, tut!&rdquo; scolded Jenny. &ldquo;Think a minute, Peter! Think a
      minute! Haven't you ever seen Redhead on the ground?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter blinked his eyes. &ldquo;Ye-e-s,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;Come to think of it, I
      have. I've seen him picking up beechnuts in the fall. The Woodpeckers are
      a funny family. I don't understand them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then a long, rolling rat-a-tat-tat rang out just over their heads.
      &ldquo;There's another one of them,&rdquo; chuckled Jenny. &ldquo;That's Downy, the smallest
      of the whole family. He certainly makes an awful racket for such a little
      fellow. He is a splendid drummer and he's just as good a carpenter. He
      made the very house I am occupying now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter was sitting with his head tipped back trying to see Downy. At first
      he couldn't make him out. Then he caught a little movement on top of a
      dead limb. It was Downy's head flying back and forth as he beat his long
      roll. He was dressed all in black and white. On the back of his head was a
      little scarlet patch. He was making a tremendous racket for such a little
      chap, only a little bigger than one of the Sparrow family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he making a hole for a nest up there?&rdquo; asked Peter eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious, Peter, what a question! What a perfectly silly question!&rdquo;
       exclaimed Jenny Wren scornfully. &ldquo;Do give us birds credit for a little
      common sense. If he were cutting a hole for a nest, everybody within
      hearing would know just where to look for it. Downy has too much sense in
      that little head of his to do such a silly thing as that. When he cuts a
      hole for a nest he doesn't make any more noise than is absolutely
      necessary. You don't see any chips flying, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-o,&rdquo; replied Peter slowly. &ldquo;Now you speak of it, I don't. Is&mdash;is
      he hunting for worms in the wood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jenny laughed right out. &ldquo;Hardly, Peter, hardly,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;He's just
      drumming, that's all. That hollow limb makes the best kind of a drum and
      Downy is making the most of it. Just listen to that! There isn't a better
      drummer anywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Peter wasn't satisfied. Finally he ventured another question. &ldquo;What's
      he doing it for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good land, Peter!&rdquo; cried Jenny. &ldquo;What do you run and jump for in the
      spring? What is Mr. Wren singing for over there? Downy is drumming for
      precisely the same reason&mdash;happiness. He can't run and jump and he
      can't sing, but he can drum. By the way, do you know that Downy is one of
      the most useful birds in the Old Orchard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then Downy flew away, but hardly had he disappeared when another
      drummer took his place. At first Peter thought Downy had returned until he
      noticed that the newcomer was just a bit bigger than Downy. Jenny Wren's
      sharp eyes spied him at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;There's Hairy. Did you ever see two cousins look
      more alike? If it were not that Hairy is bigger than Downy it would be
      hard work to tell them apart. Do you see any other difference, Peter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter stared and blinked and stared again, then slowly shook his head.
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he confessed, &ldquo;I don't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That shows you haven't learned to use your eyes, Peter,&rdquo; said Jenny
      rather sharply. &ldquo;Look at the outside feathers of his tail; they are all
      white. Downy's outside tail feathers have little bars of black. Hairy is
      just as good a carpenter as is Downy, but for that matter I don't know of
      a member of the Woodpecker family who isn't a good carpenter. Where did
      you say Yellow Wing the Flicker is making his home this year?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over in the Big Hickory-tree by the Smiling Pool,&rdquo; replied Peter. &ldquo;I
      don't understand yet why Yellow Wing spends so much time on the ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ants,&rdquo; replied Jenny Wren. &ldquo;Just ants. He's as fond of ants as is Old Mr.
      Toad, and that is saying a great deal. If Yellow Wing keeps on he'll
      become a ground bird instead of a tree bird. He gets more than half his
      living on the ground now. Speaking of drumming, did you ever hear Yellow
      Wing drum on a tin roof?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if there's a tin roof anywhere around, and Yellow Wing can find it,
      he will be perfectly happy. He certainly does love to make a noise, and
      tin makes the finest kind of a drum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then Jenny was interrupted by the arrival, on the trunk of the very
      next tree to the one on which she was sitting, of a bird about the size of
      Sammy Jay. His whole head and neck were a beautiful, deep red. His breast
      was pure white, and his back was black to nearly the beginning of his
      tail, where it was white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Redhead!&rdquo; exclaimed Jenny Wren. &ldquo;How did you know we were talking
      about your family?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, chatterbox,&rdquo; retorted Redhead with a twinkle in his eyes. &ldquo;I
      didn't know you were talking about my family, but I could have guessed
      that you were talking about some one's family. Does your tongue ever stop,
      Jenny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jenny Wren started to become indignant and scold, then thought better of
      it. &ldquo;I was talking for Peter's benefit,&rdquo; said she, trying to look
      dignified, a thing quite impossible for any member of the Wren family to
      do. &ldquo;Peter has always had the idea that true Woodpeckers never go down on
      the ground. I was explaining to him that Yellow Wing is a true Woodpecker,
      yet spends half his time on the ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Redhead nodded. &ldquo;It's all on account of ants,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I don't know of
      any one quite so fond of ants unless it is Old Mr. Toad. I like a few of
      them myself, but Yellow Wing just about lives on them when he can. You may
      have noticed that I go down on the ground myself once in a while. I am
      rather fond of beetles, and an occasional grasshopper tastes very good to
      me. I like a variety. Yes, sir, I certainly do like a variety&mdash;cherries,
      blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, grapes. In fact most kinds of
      fruit taste good to me, not to mention beechnuts and acorns when there is
      no fruit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jenny Wren tossed her head. &ldquo;You didn't mention the eggs of some of your
      neighbors,&rdquo; said she sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Redhead did his best to look innocent, but Peter noticed that he gave a
      guilty start and very abruptly changed the subject, and a moment later
      flew away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it true,&rdquo; asked Peter, &ldquo;that Redhead does such a dreadful thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jenny bobbed her head rapidly and jerked her tail. &ldquo;So I an told,&rdquo; said
      she. &ldquo;I've never seen him do it, but I know others who have. They say he
      is no better than Sammy Jay or Blacky the Crow. But gracious, goodness! I
      can't sit here gossiping forever.&rdquo; Jenny twitched her funny little tail,
      snapped her bright eyes at Peter, and disappeared in her house.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. Some Unlikely Relatives.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Having other things to attend to, or rather having other things to arouse
      his curiosity, Peter Rabbit did not visit the Old Orchard for several
      days. When he did it was to find the entire neighborhood quite upset.
      There was an indignation meeting in progress in and around the tree in
      which Chebec and his modest little wife had their home. How the tongues
      did clatter! Peter knew that something had happened, but though he
      listened with all his might he couldn't make head or tail of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally Peter managed to get the attention of Jenny Wren. &ldquo;What's
      happened?&rdquo; demanded Peter. &ldquo;What's all this fuss about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jenny Wren was so excited that she couldn't keep still an instant. Her
      sharp little eyes snapped and her tail was carried higher than ever. &ldquo;It's
      a disgrace! It's a disgrace to the whole feathered race, and something
      ought to be done about it!&rdquo; sputtered Jenny. &ldquo;I'm ashamed to think that
      such a contemptible creature wears feathers! I am so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what's it all about?&rdquo; demanded Peter impatiently. &ldquo;Do keep still long
      enough to tell me. Who is this contemptible creature?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sally Sly,&rdquo; snapped Jenny Wren. &ldquo;Sally Sly the Cowbird. I hoped she
      wouldn't disgrace the Old Orchard this year, but she has. When Mr. and
      Mrs. Chebec returned from getting their breakfast this morning they found
      one of Sally Sly's eggs in their nest. They are terribly upset, and I
      don't blame them. If I were in their place I simply would throw that egg
      out. That's what I'd do, I'd throw that egg out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter was puzzled. He blinked his eyes and stroked his whiskers as he
      tried to understand what it all meant. &ldquo;Who is Sally Sly, and what did she
      do that for?&rdquo; he finally ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For goodness' sake, Peter Rabbit, do you mean to tell me you don't know
      who Sally Sly is?&rdquo; Then without waiting for Peter to reply, Jenny rattled
      on. &ldquo;She's a member of the Blackbird family and she's the laziest, most
      good-for-nothing, sneakiest, most unfeeling and most selfish wretch I know
      of!&rdquo; Jenny paused long enough to get her breath. &ldquo;She laid that egg in
      Chebec's nest because she is too lazy to build a nest of her own and too
      selfish to take care of her own children. Do you know what will happen,
      Peter Rabbit? Do you know what will happen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter shook his head and confessed that he didn't. &ldquo;When that egg hatches
      out, that young Cowbird will be about twice as big as Chebec's own
      children,&rdquo; sputtered Jenny. &ldquo;He'll be so big that he'll get most of the
      food. He'll just rob those little Chebecs in spite of all their mother and
      father can do. And Chebec and his wife will be just soft-hearted enough to
      work themselves to skin and bone to feed the young wretch because he is an
      orphan and hasn't anybody to look after him. The worst of it is, Sally Sly
      is likely to play the same trick on others. She always chooses the nest of
      some one smaller than herself. She's terribly sly. No one has seen her
      about. She just sneaked into the Old Orchard this morning when everybody
      was busy, laid that egg and sneaked out again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you say that she is a member of the Blackbird family?&rdquo; asked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jenny Wren nodded vigorously. &ldquo;That's what she is,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Thank
      goodness, she isn't a member of MY family. If she were I never would be
      able to hold my head up. Just listen to Goldy the Oriole over in that big
      elm. I don't see how he can sing like that, knowing that one of his
      relatives has just done such a shameful deed. It's a queer thing that
      there can be two members of the same family so unlike. Mrs. Goldy builds
      one of the most wonderful nests of any one I know, and Sally Sly is too
      lazy to build any. If I were in Goldy's place I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; cried Peter. &ldquo;I thought you said Sally Sly is a member of the
      Blackbird family. I don't see what she's got to do with Goldy the Oriole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't, eh?&rdquo; exclaimed Jenny. &ldquo;Well, for one who pokes into other
      people's affairs as you do, you don't know much. The Orioles and the
      Meadow Larks and the Grackles and the Bobolinks all belong to the
      Blackbird family. They're all related to Redwing the Blackbird, and Sally
      Sly the Cowbird belongs in the same family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter gasped. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;hadn't the least idea that any of these
      folks were related,&rdquo; stammered Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they are,&rdquo; retorted Jenny Wren. &ldquo;As I live, there's Sally Sly now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter caught a glimpse of a brownish-gray bird who reminded him somewhat
      of Mrs. Redwing. She was about the same size and looked very much like
      her. It was plain that she was trying to keep out of sight, and the
      instant she knew that she had been discovered she flew away in the
      direction of the Old Pasture. It happened that late that afternoon Peter
      visited the Old Pasture and saw her again. She and some of her friends
      were busily walking about close to the feet of the cows, where they seemed
      to be picking up food. One had a brown head, neck and breast; the rest of
      his coat was glossy black. Peter rightly guessed that this must be Mr.
      Cowbird. Seeing them on such good terms with the cows he understood why
      they are called Cowbirds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sure that Sally Sly had left the Old Orchard, the feathered folks settled
      down to their personal affairs and household cares, Jenny Wren among them.
      Having no one to talk to, Peter found a shady place close to the old stone
      wall and there sat down to think over the surprising things he had
      learned. Presently Goldy the Baltimore Oriole alighted in the nearest
      apple-tree, and it seemed to Peter that never had he seen any one more
      beautifully dressed. His head, neck, throat and upper part of his back
      were black. The lower part of his back and his breast were a beautiful
      deep orange color. There was a dash of orange on his shoulders, but the
      rest of his wings were black with an edging of white. His tail was black
      and orange. Peter had heard him called the Firebird, and now he understood
      why. His song was quite as rich and beautiful as his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly he was joined by Mrs. Goldy. Compared with her handsome husband
      she was very modestly dressed. She wore more brown than black, and where
      the orange color appeared it was rather dull. She wasted no time in
      singing. Almost instantly her sharp eyes spied a piece of string caught in
      the bushes almost over Peter's head. With a little cry of delight she flew
      down and seized it. But the string was caught, and though she tugged and
      pulled with all her might she couldn't get it free. Goldy saw the trouble
      she was having and cutting his song short, flew down to help her. Together
      they pulled and tugged and tugged and pulled, until they had to stop to
      rest and get their breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We simply must have this piece of string,&rdquo; said Mrs. Goldy. &ldquo;I've been
      hunting everywhere for a piece, and this is the first I've found. It is
      just what we need to bind our nest fast to the twigs. With this I won't
      have the least bit of fear that that nest will ever tear loose, no matter
      how hard the wind blows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more they tugged and pulled and pulled and tugged until at last they
      got it free, and Mrs. Goldy flew away in triumph with the string in her
      bill. Goldy himself followed. Peter watched them fly to the top of a long,
      swaying branch of a big elm-tree up near Farmer Brown's house. He could
      see something which looked like a bag hanging there, and he knew that this
      must be the nest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious!&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;They must get terribly tossed about when the wind
      blows. I should think their babies would be thrown out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you worry about them,&rdquo; said a voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter looked up to find Welcome Robin just over him. &ldquo;Mrs. Goldy makes one
      of the most wonderful nests I know of,&rdquo; continued Welcome Robin. &ldquo;It is
      like a deep pocket made of grass, string, hair and bark, all woven
      together like a piece of cloth. It is so deep that it is quite safe for
      the babies, and they seem to enjoy being rocked by the wind. I shouldn't
      care for it myself because I like a solid foundation for my home, but the
      Goldies like it. It looks dangerous but it really is one of the safest
      nests I know of. Snakes and cats never get 'way up there and there are few
      feathered nest-robbers who can get at those eggs so deep down in the nest.
      Goldy is sometimes called Golden Robin. He isn't a Robin at all, but I
      would feel very proud if he were a member of my family. He's just as
      useful as he is handsome, and that's saying a great deal. He just dotes on
      caterpillars. There's Mrs. Robin calling me. Good-by, Peter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this Welcome Robin flew away and Peter once more settled himself to
      think over all he had learned.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII. More of the Blackbird Family.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Peter Rabbit was dozing. Yes, sir, Peter was dozing. He didn't mean to
      doze, but whenever Peter sits still for a long time and tries to think, he
      is pretty sure to go to sleep. By and by he wakened with a start. At first
      he didn't know what had wakened him, but as he sat there blinking his
      eyes, he heard a few rich notes from the top of the nearest apple-tree.
      &ldquo;It's Goldy the Oriole,&rdquo; thought Peter, and peeped out to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though he looked and looked he couldn't see Goldy anywhere, but he did
      see a stranger. It was some one of about Goldy's size and shape. In fact
      he was so like Goldy, but for the color of his suit, that at first Peter
      almost thought Goldy had somehow changed his clothes. Of course he knew
      that this couldn't be, but it seemed as if it must be, for the song the
      stranger was singing was something like that of Goldy. The stranger's head
      and throat and back were black, just like Goldy's, and his wings were
      trimmed with white in just the same way. But the rest of his suit, instead
      of being the beautiful orange of which Goldy is so proud, was a beautiful
      chestnut color.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter blinked and stared very hard. &ldquo;Now who can this be?&rdquo; said he,
      speaking aloud without thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you know him?&rdquo; asked a sharp voice so close to Peter that it made
      him jump. Peter whirled around. There sat Striped Chipmunk grinning at him
      from the top of the old stone wall. &ldquo;That's Weaver the Orchard Oriole,&rdquo;
       Striped Chipmunk rattled on. &ldquo;If you don't know him you ought to, because
      he is one of the very nicest persons in the Old Orchard. I just love to
      hear him sing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is&mdash;is&mdash;he related to Goldy?&rdquo; asked Peter somewhat doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; retorted Striped Chipmunk. &ldquo;I shouldn't think you would have
      to look at him more than once to know that. He's first cousin to Goldy.
      There comes Mrs. Weaver. I do hope they've decided to build in the Old
      Orchard this year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad you told me who she is because I never would have guessed it,&rdquo;
       confessed Peter as he studied the newcomer. She did not look at all like
      Weaver. She was dressed in olive-green and dull yellow, with white
      markings on her wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter couldn't help thinking how much easier it must be for her than for
      her handsome husband to hide among the green leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he watched she flew down to the ground and picked up a long piece of
      grass. &ldquo;They are building here, as sure as you live!&rdquo; cried Striped
      Chipmunk. &ldquo;I'm glad of that. Did you ever see their nest, Peter? Of course
      you haven't, because you said you had never seen them before. Their nest
      is a wonder, Peter. It really is. It is made almost wholly of fine grass
      and they weave it together in the most wonderful way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do they have a hanging nest like Goldy's?&rdquo; asked Peter a bit timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not such a deep one,&rdquo; replied Striped Chipmunk. &ldquo;They hang it between the
      twigs near the end of a branch, but they bind it more closely to the
      branch and it isn't deep enough to swing as Goldy's does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter had just opened his mouth to ask another question when there was a
      loud sniffing sound farther up along the old stone wall. He didn't wait to
      hear it again. He knew that Bowser the Hound was coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by, Striped Chipmunk! This is no place for me,&rdquo; whispered Peter and
      started for the dear Old Briar-patch. He was in such a hurry to get there
      that on his way across the Green Meadows he almost ran into Jimmy Skunk
      before he saw him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's your hurry, Peter?&rdquo; demanded Jimmy
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bowser the Hound almost found me up in the Old Orchard,&rdquo; panted Peter.
      &ldquo;It's a wonder he hasn't found my tracks. I expect he will any minute. I'm
      glad to see you, Jimmy, but I guess I'd better be moving along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be in such a hurry, Peter. Don't be in such a hurry,&rdquo; replied
      Jimmy, who himself never hurries. &ldquo;Stop and talk a bit. That old nuisance
      won't bother you as long as you are with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter hesitated. He wanted to gossip, but he still felt nervous about
      Bowser the Hound. However, as he heard nothing of Bowser's great voice,
      telling all the world that he had found Peter's tracks, he decided to stop
      a few minutes. &ldquo;What are you doing down here on the Green Meadows?&rdquo; he
      demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy grinned. &ldquo;I'm looking for grasshoppers and grubs, if you must know,&rdquo;
       said he. &ldquo;And I've just got a notion I may find some fresh eggs. I don't
      often eat them, but once in a while one tastes good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you ask me, it's a funny place to be looking for eggs down here on the
      Green Meadows,&rdquo; replied Peter. &ldquo;When I want a thing; I look for it where
      it is likely to be found.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so, Peter; just so,&rdquo; retorted Jimmy Skunk, nodding his head with
      approval. &ldquo;That's why I am here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter looked puzzled. He was puzzled. But before he could ask another
      question a rollicking song caused both of them to look up. There on
      quivering wings in mid-air was the singer. He was dressed very much like
      Jimmy Skunk himself, in black and white, save that in places the white had
      a tinge of yellow, especially on the back of his neck. It was Bubbling Bob
      the Bobolink. And how he did sing! It seemed as if the notes fairly
      tumbled over each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy Skunk raised himself on his hind-legs a little to see just where
      Bubbling Bob dropped down in the grass. Then Jimmy began to move in that
      direction. Suddenly Peter understood. He remembered that Bubbling Bob's
      nest is always on the ground. It was his eggs that Jimmy Skunk was looking
      for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't happen to have seen Mrs. Bob anywhere around here, do you,
      Peter?&rdquo; asked Jimmy, trying to speak carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Peter. &ldquo;If I had I wouldn't tell you where. You ought to be
      ashamed, Jimmy Skunk, to think of robbing such a beautiful singer as
      Bubbling Bob.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; retorted Jimmy. &ldquo;What's the harm? If I find those eggs he and Mrs.
      Bob could simply build another nest and lay some more. They won't be any
      the worse off, and I will have had a good breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But think of all the work they would have to do to build another nest,&rdquo;
       replied Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should worry,&rdquo; retorted Jimmy Skunk. &ldquo;Any one who can spend so much
      time singing can afford to do a little extra work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're horrid, Jimmy Skunk. You're just horrid,&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;I hope you
      won't find a single egg, so there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this, Peter once more headed for the dear Old Briar-patch, while
      Jimmy Skunk continued toward the place where Bubbling Bob had disappeared
      in the long grass. Peter went only a short distance and then sat up to
      watch Jimmy Skunk. Just before Jimmy reached the place where Bubbling Bob
      had disappeared, the latter mounted into the air again, pouring out his
      rollicking song as if there were no room in his heart for anything but
      happiness. Then he saw Jimmy Shrunk and became very much excited. He flew
      down in the grass a little farther on and then up again, and began to
      scold.
    </p>
    <p>
      It looked very much as if he had gone down in the grass to warn Mrs. Bob.
      Evidently Jimmy thought so, for he at once headed that way. When Bubbling
      Bob did the same thing all over again. Peter grew anxious. He knew just
      how patient Jimmy Skunk could be, and he very much feared that Jimmy would
      find that nest. Presently he grew tired of watching and started on for the
      dear Old Briar-patch. Just before he reached it a brown bird, who reminded
      him somewhat of Mrs. Redwing and Sally Sly the Cowbird, though she was
      smaller, ran across the path in front of him and then flew up to the top
      of a last year's mullein stalk. It was Mrs. Bobolink. Peter knew her well,
      for he and she were very good friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Peter. &ldquo;What are you doing here? Don't you know that Jimmy
      Skunk, is hunting for your nest over there? Aren't you worried to death? I
      would be if I were in your place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bob chuckled. &ldquo;Isn't he a dear? And isn't he smart?&rdquo; said she,
      meaning Bubbling Bob, of course, and not Jimmy Skunk. &ldquo;Just see him lead
      that black-and-white robber away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter stared at her for a full minute. &ldquo;Do you mean to say,&rdquo; said he &ldquo;that
      your nest isn't over there at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bob chuckled harder than ever. &ldquo;Of course it isn't over there,&rdquo; said
      she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then where is it?&rdquo; demanded Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's telling,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Bob. &ldquo;It isn't over there, and it isn't
      anywhere near there. But where it is is Bob's secret and mine, and we mean
      to keep it. Now I must go get something to eat,&rdquo; and with a hasty farewell
      Mrs. Bobolink flew over to the other side of the dear Old Briar-patch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter remembered that he had seen Mrs. Bob running along the ground before
      she flew up to the old mullein stalk. He went back to the spot where he
      had first seen her and hunted all around in the grass, but without
      success. You see, Mrs. Bobolink had been quite as clever in fooling Peter
      as Bubbling Bob had been in fooling Jimmy Skunk.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV. Bob White and Carol the Meadow Lark.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bob&mdash;Bob White! Bob&mdash;Bob White! Bob&mdash;Bob White!&rdquo; clear and
      sweet, that call floated over to the dear Old Briar-patch until Peter
      could stand it no longer. He felt that he just had to go over and pay an
      early morning call on one of his very best friends, who at this season of
      the year delights in whistling his own name&mdash;Bob White.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; muttered Peter, &ldquo;that Bob White has got a nest. I wish he
      would show it to me. He's terribly secretive about it. Last year I hunted
      for his nest until my feet were sore, but it wasn't the least bit of use.
      Then one morning I met Mrs. Bob White with fifteen babies out for a walk.
      How she could hide a nest with fifteen eggs in it is more than I can
      understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter left the Old Briar-patch and started off over the Green Meadows
      towards the Old Pasture. As he drew near the fence between the Green
      Meadows and the Old Pasture he saw Bob White sitting on one of the posts,
      whistling with all his might. On another post near him sat another bird
      very near the size of Welcome Robin. He also was telling all the world of
      his happiness. It was Carol the Meadow Lark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter was so intent watching these two friends of his that he took no heed
      to his footsteps. Suddenly there was a whirr from almost under his very
      nose and he stopped short, so startled that he almost squealed right out.
      In a second he recognized Mrs. Meadow Lark. He watched her fly over to
      where Carol was singing. Her stout little wings moved swiftly for a moment
      or two, then she sailed on without moving them at all. Then they fluttered
      rapidly again until she was flying fast enough to once more sail on them
      outstretched. The white outer feathers of her tail showed clearly and
      reminded Peter of the tail of Sweetvoice the Vesper Sparrow, only of
      course it was ever so much bigger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter sat still until Mrs. Meadow Lark had alighted on the fence near
      Carol. Then he prepared to hurry on, for he was anxious for a bit of
      gossip with these good friends of his. But just before he did this he just
      happened to glance down and there, almost at his very feet, he caught
      sight of something that made him squeal right out. It was a nest with four
      of the prettiest eggs Peter ever had seen. They were white with brown
      spots all over them. Had it not been for the eggs he never would have seen
      that nest, never in the world. It was made of dry, brown grass and was
      cunningly hidden is a little clump of dead grass which fell over it so as
      to almost completely hide it. But the thing that surprised Peter most was
      the clever way in which the approach to it was hidden. It was by means of
      a regular little tunnel of grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Peter, and his eyes sparkled with pleasure. &ldquo;This must be the
      nest of Mrs. Meadow Lark. No wonder I have never been able to find it,
      when I have looked for it. It is just luck and nothing else that I have
      found it this time. I think it is perfectly wonderful that Mrs. Meadow
      Lark can hide her home in such a way. I do hope Jimmy Skunk isn't anywhere
      around.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter sat up straight and anxiously looked this way and that way. Jimmy
      Skunk was nowhere to be seen and Peter gave a little sigh of relief. Very
      carefully he walked around that nest and its little tunnel, then hurried
      over toward the fence as fast as he could go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's perfectly beautiful, Carol!&rdquo; he cried, just as soon as he was near
      enough. &ldquo;And I won't tell a single soul!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not. I certainly hope not,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Meadow Lark in an anxious
      tone. &ldquo;I never would have another single easy minute if I thought you
      would tell a living soul about my nest. Promise that you won't, Peter.
      Cross your heart and promise that you won't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter promptly crossed his heart and promised that he wouldn't tell a
      single soul. Mrs. Meadow Lark seemed to feel better. Right away she flew
      back and Peter turned to watch her. He saw her disappear in the grass, but
      it wasn't where he had found the nest. Peter waited a few minutes,
      thinking that he would see her rise into the air again and fly over to the
      nest. But he waited in vain. Then with a puzzled look on his face, he
      turned to look up at Carol.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carol's eyes twinkled. &ldquo;I know what you're thinking, Peter,&rdquo; he chuckled.
      &ldquo;You are thinking that it is funny Mrs. Meadow Lark didn't go straight
      hack to our nest when she seemed so anxious about it. I would have you to
      know that she is too clever to do anything so foolish as that. She knows
      well enough that somebody might see her and so find our secret. She has
      walked there from the place where you saw her disappear in the grass. That
      is the way we always do when we go to our nest. One never can be too
      careful these days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Carol began to pour out his happiness once more, quite as if nothing
      had interrupted his song.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow Peter never before had realized how handsome Carol the Meadow Lark
      was. As he faced Peter, the latter saw a beautiful yellow throat and
      waistcoat, with a broad black crescent on his breast. There was a yellow
      line above each eye. His back was of brown with black markings. His sides
      were whitish, with spats and streaks of black. The outer edges of his tail
      were white. Altogether he was really handsome, far handsomer than one
      would suspect, seeing him at a distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having found out Carol's secret, Peter was doubly anxious to find Bob
      White's home, so he hurried over to the post where Bob was whistling with
      all his might. &ldquo;Bob!&rdquo; cried Peter. &ldquo;I've just found Carol's nest and I've
      promised to keep it a secret. Won't you show me your nest, too, if I'll
      promise to keep THAT a secret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rob threw back his head and laughed joyously. &ldquo;You ought to know, Peter,
      by this time,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that there are secrets never to be told to
      anybody. My nest is one of these. If you find it, all right; but I
      wouldn't show it to my very best friend, and I guess I haven't any better
      friend than you, Peter.&rdquo; Then from sheer happiness he whistled, &ldquo;&mdash;Bob
      White! Bob&mdash;Bob White!&rdquo; with all his might.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter was disappointed and a little put out. &ldquo;I guess,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I could
      find it if I wanted to. I guess it isn't any better hidden than Mrs.
      Meadow Lark's, and I found that. Some folks aren't as smart as they think
      they are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bob White, who is sometimes called Quail and sometimes called Partridge,
      and who is neither, chuckled heartily. &ldquo;Go ahead, old Mr. Curiosity, go
      ahead and hunt all you please,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It's funny to me how some folks
      think themselves smart when the truth is they simply have been lucky. You
      know well enough that you just happened to find Carol's nest. If you
      happen to find mine, I won't have a word to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bob White took a long breath, tipped his head back until his bill was
      pointing right up in the blue, blue sky, and with all his might whistled
      his name, &ldquo;Bob&mdash;Bob White! Bob&mdash;Bob White!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Peter looked at him it came over him that Bob White was the plumpest
      bird of his acquaintance. He was so plump that his body seemed almost
      round. The shortness of his tail added to this effect, for Bob has a very
      short tail. The upper part of his coat was a handsome reddish-brown with
      dark streaks and light edgings. His sides and the upper part of his breast
      were of the same handsome reddish-brown, while underneath he was whitish
      with little bars of black. His throat was white, and above each eye was a
      broad white stripe. His white throat was bordered with black, and a band
      of black divided the throat from the white line above each eye. The top of
      his head was mixed black and brown. Altogether he was a handsome little
      fellow in a modest way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Bob White stopped whistling and looked down at Peter with a
      twinkle in his eye. &ldquo;Why don't you go hunt for that nest, Peter?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going,&rdquo; replied Peter rather shortly, for he knew that Bob knew that
      he hadn't the least idea where to look. It might be somewhere on the Green
      Meadows or it might be in the Old Pasture; Bob hadn't given the least
      hint. Peter had a feeling that the nest wasn't far away and that it was on
      the Green Meadows, so he began to hunt, running aimlessly this way and
      that way, all the time feeling very foolish, for of course he knew that
      Bob White was watching him and chuckling down inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very warm down there on the Green Meadows, and Peter grew hot and
      tired. He decided to run up in the Old Pasture in the shade of an old
      bramble-tangle there. Just the other side of the fence was a path made by
      the cows and often used by Farmer Brown's boy and Reddy Fox and others who
      visited the Old Pasture. Along this Peter scampered,
      lipperty-lipperty-lip, on his way to the bramble-tangle. He didn't look
      either to right or left. It didn't occur to him that there would be any
      use at all, for of course no one would build a nest near a path where
      people passed to and fro every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it was that in his happy-go-lucky way Peter scampered right past a
      clump of tall weeds close beside the path without the least suspicion that
      cleverly hidden in it was the very thing he was looking for. With laughter
      in her eyes, shrewd little Mrs. Bob White, with sixteen white eggs under
      her, watched him pass. She had chosen that very place for her nest because
      she knew that it was the last place anyone would expect to find it. The
      very fact that it seemed the most dangerous place she could have chosen
      made it the safest.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV. A Swallow and One Who Isn't.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Johnny and Polly Chuck had made their home between the roots of an old
      apple-tree in the far corner of the Old Orchard. You know they have their
      bedroom way down in the ground, and it is reached by a long hall. They had
      dug their home between the roots of that old apple-tree because they had
      discovered that there was just room enough between those spreading roots
      for them to pass in and out, and there wasn't room to dig the entrance any
      larger. So they felt quite safe from Reddy Fox; and Bowser the Hound,
      either of whom would have delighted to dig them out but for those roots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Right in front of their doorway was a very nice doorstep of shining sand
      where Johnny Chuck delighted to sit when he had a full stomach and nothing
      else to do. Johnny's nearest neighbors had made their home only about five
      feet above Johnny's head when he sat up on his doorstep. They were Skimmer
      the Tree Swallow and his trim little wife, and the doorway of their home
      was a little round hole in the trunk of that apple-tree, a hole which had
      been cut some years before by one of the Woodpeckers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnny and Skimmer were the best of friends. Johnny used to delight in
      watching Skimmer dart out from beneath the branches of the trees and wheel
      and turn and glide, now sometimes high in the blue, blue sky, and again
      just skimming the tops of the grass, on wings which seemed never to tire.
      But he liked still better the bits of gossip when Skimmer would sit in his
      doorway and chat about his neighbors of the Old Orchard and his adventures
      out in the Great World during his long journeys to and from the far-away
      South.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Johnny Chuck's way of thinking, there was no one quite so trim and neat
      appearing as Skimmer with his snowy white breast and blue-green back and
      wings. Two things Johnny always used to wonder at, Skimmer's small bill
      and short legs. Finally he ventured to ask Skimmer about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious, Johnny!&rdquo; exclaimed Skimmer. &ldquo;I wouldn't have a big bill for
      anything. I wouldn't know what to do with it; it would be in the way. You
      see, I get nearly all my food in the air when I am flying, mosquitoes and
      flies and all sorts of small insects with wings. I don't have to pick them
      off trees and bushes or from the ground and so I don't need any more of a
      bill than I have. It's the same way with my legs. Have you ever seen me
      walking on the ground?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnny thought a moment. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;now you speak of it, I never
      have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have you ever seen me hopping about in the branches of a tree?&rdquo;
       persisted Skimmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Johnny Chuck admitted that he never had.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only use I have for feet,&rdquo; continued Skimmer, &ldquo;is for perching while
      I rest. I don't need long legs for walking or hopping about, so Mother
      Nature has made my legs very short. You see I spend most of my time in the
      air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it's the same with your cousin; Sooty the Chimney Swallow,&rdquo;
       said Johnny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That shows just how much some people know!&rdquo; twittered Skimmer
      indignantly. &ldquo;The idea of calling Sooty a Swallow! The very idea! I'd
      leave you to know, Johnny Chuck, that Sooty isn't even related to me. He's
      a Swift, and not a Swallow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looks like a Swallow,&rdquo; protested Johnny Chuck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn't either. You just think he does because he happens to spend
      most of his time in the air the way we Swallows do,&rdquo; sputtered Skimmer.
      &ldquo;The Swallow family never would admit such a homely looking fellow as he
      is as a member.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, tut, tut, tut! I do believe Skimmer is jealous,&rdquo; cried Jenny Wren,
      who had happened along just in time to hear Skimmer's last remarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing of the sort,&rdquo; declared Skimmer, growing still more indignant.
      &ldquo;I'd like to know what there is about Sooty the Chimney Swift that could
      possibly make a Swallow jealous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jenny Wren cocked her tail up in that saucy way of hers and winked at
      Johnny Chuck. &ldquo;The way he can fly,&rdquo; said she softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The way he can fly!&rdquo; sputtered Skimmer, &ldquo;The way he can fly! Why, there
      never was a day in his life that he could fly like a Swallow. There isn't
      any one more graceful on the wing than I am, if I do say so. And there
      isn't any one more ungraceful than Sooty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then there was a shrill chatter overhead and all looked up to see
      Sooty the Chimney Swift racing through the sky as if having the very best
      time in the world. His wings would beat furiously and then he would glide
      very much as you or I would on skates. It was quite true that he wasn't
      graceful. But he could twist and turn and cut up all sorts of antics, such
      as Skimmer never dreamed of doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can use first one wing and then the other, while you have to use both
      wings at once,&rdquo; persisted Jenny Wren. &ldquo;You couldn't, to save your life, go
      straight down into a chimney, and you know it, Skimmer. He can do things
      with his wings which you can't do, nor any other bird.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be true, but just the same I'm not the least teeny weeny bit
      jealous of him,&rdquo; said Skimmer, and darted away to get beyond the reach of
      Jenny's sharp tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it really true that he and Sooty are not related?&rdquo; asked Johnny Chuck,
      as they watched Skimmer cutting airy circles high up in the slay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jenny nodded. &ldquo;It's quite true, Johnny,&rdquo; said site. &ldquo;Sooty belongs to
      another family altogether. He's a funny fellow. Did you ever in your life
      see such narrow wings? And his tail is hardly worth calling a tail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnny Chuck laughed. &ldquo;Way up there in the air he looks almost alike at
      both ends,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Is he all black?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He isn't black at all,&rdquo; declared Jenny. &ldquo;He is sooty-brown, rather
      grayish on the throat and breast. Speaking of that tail of his, the
      feathers end in little, sharp, stiff points. He uses them in the same way
      that Downy the Woodpecker uses his tail feathers when he braces himself
      with them on the trunk of a tree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I've never seen Sooty on the trunk of a tree,&rdquo; protested Johnny
      Chuck. &ldquo;In fact, I've never seen him anywhere but in the air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you never will,&rdquo; snapped Jenny. &ldquo;The only place he ever alights is
      inside a chimney or inside a hollow tree. There he clings to the side just
      as Downy the Woodpecker clings to the trunk of a tree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnny looked as if he didn't quite believe this. &ldquo;If that's the case
      where does he nest?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;And where does he sleep?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a chimney, stupid. In a chimney, of course,&rdquo; retorted Jenny Wren. &ldquo;He
      fastens his nest right to the inside of a chimney. He makes a regular
      little basket of twigs and fastens it to the side of the chimney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you trying to stuff me with nonsense?&rdquo; asked Johnny Chuck
      indignantly. &ldquo;How can he fasten his nest to the side of a chimney unless
      there's a little shelf to put it on? And if he never alights, how does he
      get the little sticks to make a nest of? I'd just like to know how you
      expect me to believe any such story as that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jenny Wren's sharp little eyes snapped. &ldquo;If you half used your eyes you
      wouldn't have to ask me how he gets those little sticks,&rdquo; she sputtered.
      &ldquo;If you had watched him when he was flying close to the tree tops you
      would have seen him clutch little dead twigs in his claws and snap them
      off without stopping. That's the way he gets his little sticks, Mr.
      Smarty, He fastens them together with a sticky substance he has in his
      mouth, and he fastens the nest to the side of the chimney in the same way.
      You can believe it or not, but it's so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe it, Jenny, I believe it,&rdquo; replied Johnny Chuck very humbly. &ldquo;If
      you please, Jenny, does Sooty get all his food in the air too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; replied Jenny tartly. &ldquo;He eats nothing but insects, and he
      catches them flying. Now I must get back to my duties at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just tell me one more thing,&rdquo; cried Johnny Chuck hastily. &ldquo;Hasn't Sooty
      any near relatives as most birds have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hasn't any one nearer than some sort of second cousins, Boomer the
      Nighthawk, Whippoorwill, and Hummer the Hummingbird.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried Johnny Chuck, quite as if he couldn't believe he had heard
      aright. &ldquo;Did you say Hummer the Hummingbird?&rdquo; But he got no reply, for
      Jenny Wren was already beyond hearing.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI. A Robber in the Old Orchard.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe it,&rdquo; muttered Johnny Chuck out loud. &ldquo;I don't believe
      Jenny Wren knows what she's talking about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it Jenny Wren has said that you don't believe?&rdquo; demanded Skimmer
      the Tree Swallow, as he once more settled himself in his doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She said that Hummer the Hummingbird is a sort of second cousin to Sooty
      the Chimney Swift,&rdquo; replied Johnny Chuck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it's so, if you don't believe it,&rdquo; declared Skimmer. &ldquo;I don't see
      that that is any harder to believe than that you are cousin to Striped
      Chipmunk and Nappy Jack the Gray Squirrel. To look at you no one would
      ever think you are a member of the Squirrel family, but you must admit
      that you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnny Chuck nodded his head thoughtfully. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am, even if
      I don't look it. This is a funny world, isn't it? You can't always tell by
      a person's looks who he may be related to. Now that I've found out that
      Sooty isn't related to you and is related to Hummer, I'll never dare guess
      again about anybody's relatives. I always supposed Twitter the Martin to
      be a relative of yours, but now that I've learned that Sooty isn't, I
      suspect that Twitter isn't either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, he is,&rdquo; replied Skimmer promptly. &ldquo;He's the largest of the
      Swallow family, and we all feel very proud of him. Everybody loves him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he as black as he looks, flying round up in the air?&rdquo; asked Johnny
      Chuck. &ldquo;He never comes down here as you do where a fellow can get a good
      look at him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Skimmer, &ldquo;he dresses all in black, but it is a beautiful
      blue-black, and when the sun shines on his back it seems to be almost
      purple. That is why some folks call him the Purple Martin. He is one of
      the most social fellows I know of. I like a home by myself, such as I've
      got here, but Twitter loves company. He likes to live in an apartment
      house with a lot of his own kind. That is why he always looks for one of
      those houses with a lot of rooms in it, such as Farmer Brown's boy has put
      up on the top of that tall pole out in his back yard. He pays for all the
      trouble Farmer Brown's boy took to put that house up. If there is anybody
      who catches more flies and winged insects than Twitter, I don't know who
      it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about me?&rdquo; demanded a new voice, as a graceful form skimmed over
      Johnny Chuck's head, and turning like a flash, came back. It was Forktail
      the Barn Swallow, the handsomest and one of the most graceful of all the
      Swallow family. He passed so close to Johnny that the latter had a
      splendid chance to see and admire his glistening steel-blue back and the
      beautiful chestnut-brown of his forehead and throat with its narrow black
      collar, and the brown to buff color of his under parts. But the thing that
      was most striking about him was his tail, which was so deeply forked as to
      seem almost like two tails.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would know him as far as I could see him just by his tail alone,&rdquo;
       exclaimed Johnny. &ldquo;I don't know of any other tail at all like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn't any other like it,&rdquo; declared Skimmer. &ldquo;If Twitter the Martin
      is the largest of our family, Forktail is the handsomest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about my usefulness?&rdquo; demanded Forktail, as he came skimming past
      again. &ldquo;Cousin Twitter certainly does catch a lot of flies and insects but
      I'm willing to go against him any day to see who can catch the most.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this he darted away. Watching him they saw him alight on the top of
      Farmer Brown's barn. &ldquo;It's funny,&rdquo; remarked Johnny Chuck, &ldquo;but as long as
      I've known Forktail, and I've known him ever since I was big enough to
      know anybody, I've never found out how he builds his nest. I've seen him
      skimming over the Green Meadows times without number, and often he comes
      here to the Old Orchard as he did just now, but I've never seen him stop
      anywhere except over on that barn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's where he nests,&rdquo; chuckled Skimmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried Johnny Chuck. &ldquo;Do you mean to say he nests on Farmer Brown's
      barn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Skimmer. &ldquo;He nests in it. That's why he is called the Barn
      Swallow, and why you never have seen his nest. If you'll just go over to
      Farmer Brown's barn and look up in the roof, you'll see Forktail's nest
      there somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me go over to Farmer Brown's barn!&rdquo; exclaimed Johnny Chuck. &ldquo;Do you think
      I'm crazy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Skimmer chuckled. &ldquo;Forktail isn't crazy,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and he goes in and out
      of that barn all day long. I must say I wouldn't care to build in such a
      place myself, but he seems to like it. There's one thing about it, his
      home is warm and dry and comfortable, no matter what the weather is. I
      wouldn't trade with him, though. No, sir, I wouldn't trade with him for
      anything. Give me a hollow in a tree well lined with feathers to a nest
      made of mud and straw, even if it is feather-lined.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that such a neat-looking, handsome fellow as Forktail uses
      mud in his nest?&rdquo; cried Johnny.
    </p>
    <p>
      Skimmer bobbed his head. &ldquo;He does just that,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;He's something
      like Welcome Robin in this respect. I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Johnny Chuck never knew what Skimmer was going to say next, for
      Skimmer happened at that instant to glance up. For an instant he sat
      motionless with horror, then with a shriek he darted out into the air. At
      the sound of that shriek Mrs. Skimmer, who all the time had been sitting
      on her eggs inside the hollow of the tree, darted out of her doorway, also
      shrieking. For a moment Johnny Chuck couldn't imagine what could be the
      trouble. Then a slight rustling drew his eyes to a crotch in the tree a
      little above the doorway of Skimmer's home. There, partly coiled around a
      branch, with head swaying to and fro, eyes glittering and forked tongue
      darting out and in, as he tried to look down into Skimmer's nest, was Mr.
      Blacksnake.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to Johnny as if in a minute every bird in the Old Orchard had
      arrived on the scene. Such a shrieking and screaming as there was! First
      one and then another would dart at Mr. Blacksnake, only to lose courage at
      the last second and turn aside. Poor Skimmer and his little wife were
      frantic. They did their utmost to distract Mr. Blacksnake's attention,
      darting almost into his very face and then away again before he could
      strike. But Mr. Blacksnake knew that they were powerless to hurt him, and
      he knew that there were eggs in that nest. There is nothing he loves
      better than eggs unless it is a meal of baby birds. Beyond hissing angrily
      two or three times he paid no attention to Skimmer or his friends, but
      continued to creep nearer the entrance to that nest.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he reached a position where he could put his head in the doorway.
      As he did so, Skimmer and Mrs. Skimmer each gave a little cry of
      hopelessness and despair. But no sooner had his head disappeared in the
      hole in the old apple-tree than Scrapper the Kingbird struck him savagely.
      Instantly Mr. Blacksnake withdrew his head, hissing fiercely, and struck
      savagely at the birds nearest him. Several times the same thing happened.
      No sooner would his head disappear in that hole than Scrapper or one or
      the other of Skimmer's friends, braver than the rest, would dart in and
      peck at him viciously, and all the time all the birds were screaming as
      only excited feathered folk can. Johnny Chuck was quite as excited as his
      feathered friends, and so intent watching the hated black robber that he
      had eyes for nothing else. Suddenly he heard a step just behind him. He
      turned his head and then frantically dived head first down into his hole.
      He had looked right up into the eyes of Farmer Brown's boy!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, ha!&rdquo; cried Farmer Brown's boy, &ldquo;I thought as much!&rdquo; And with a long
      switch he struck Mr. Blacksnake just as the latter had put his head in
      that doorway, resolved to get those eggs this time. But when he felt that
      switch and heard the voice of Farmer Brown's boy he changed his mind in a
      flash. He simply let go his hold on that tree and dropped. The instant he
      touched the ground he was off like a shot for the safety of the old stone
      wall, Farmer Brown's boy after him. Farmer Brown's boy didn't intend to
      kill Mr. Blacksnake, but he did want to give him such a fright that he
      wouldn't visit the Old Orchard again in a hurry, and this he quite
      succeeded in doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner had Mr. Blacksnake disappeared than all the birds set up such a
      rejoicing that you would have thought they, and not Farmer Brown's boy,
      had saved the eggs of Mr. and Mrs. Skimmer. Listening to them, Johnny
      Chuck just had to smile.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII. More Robbers.
    </h2>
    <p>
      By the sounds of rejoicing among the feathered folks of the Old Orchard
      Johnny Chuck knew that it was quite safe for him to come out. He was eager
      to tell Skimmer the Tree Swallow how glad he was that Mr. Blacksnake had
      been driven away before he could get Skimmer's eggs. As he poked his head
      out of his doorway he became aware that something was still wrong in the
      Old Orchard. Into the glad chorus there broke a note of distress and
      sorrow. Johnny instantly recognized the voices of Welcome Robin and Mrs.
      Robin. There is not one among his feathered neighbors who can so express
      worry and sorrow as can the Robins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnny was just in time to see all the birds hurrying over to that part of
      the Old Orchard where the Robins had built their home. The rejoicing
      suddenly gave way to cries of indignation and anger, and Johnny caught the
      words, &ldquo;Robber! Thief! Wretch!&rdquo; It appeared that there was just as much
      excitement over there as there had been when Mr. Blacksnake had been
      discovered trying to rob Skimmer and Mrs. Skimmer. It couldn't be Mr.
      Blacksnake again, because Farmer Brown's boy had chased him in quite
      another direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it now?&rdquo; asked Johnny of Skimmer, who was still excitedly
      discussing with Mrs. Skimmer their recent fright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know, but I'm going to find out,&rdquo; replied Skimmer and darted
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnny Chuck waited patiently. The excitement among the birds seemed to
      increase, and the chattering and angry cries grew louder. Only the voices
      of Welcome and Mrs. Robin were not angry. They were mournful, as if
      Welcome and Mrs. Robin were heartbroken. Presently Skimmer came back to
      tell Mrs. Skimmer the news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Robins have lost their eggs!&rdquo; he cried excitedly. &ldquo;All four have been
      broken and eaten. Mrs. Robin left them to come over here to help drive
      away Mr. Blacksnake, and while she was here some one ate those eggs.
      Nobody knows who it could have been, because all the birds of the Old
      Orchard were over here at that time. It might leave been Chatterer the Red
      Squirrel, or it might have been Sammy Jay, or it might have been Creaker
      the Grackle, or it might have been Blacky the Crow. Whoever it was just
      took that chance to sneak over there and rob that nest when there was no
      one to see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then from over towards the Green Forest sounded a mocking &ldquo;Caw, caw,
      caw!&rdquo; Instantly the noise in the Old Orchard ceased for a moment. Then it
      broke out afresh. There wasn't a doubt now in any one's mind. Blacky the
      Crow was the robber. How those tongues did go! There was nothing too bad
      to say about Blacky. And such dreadful things as those birds promised to
      do to Blacky the Crow if ever they should catch him in the Old Orchard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Caw, caw, caw!&rdquo; shouted Blacky from the distance, and his voice sounded
      very much as if he thought he had done something very smart. It was quite
      clear that at least he was not sorry for what he had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the birds were so excited and so angry, as they gathered around
      Welcome and Mrs. Robin trying to comfort them, that it was some time
      before their indignation meeting broke up and they returned to their own
      homes and duties. Almost at once there was another cry of distress. Mr.
      and Mrs. Chebec had been robbed of their eggs! While they had been
      attending the indignation meeting at the home of the Robins, a thief had
      taken the chance to steal their eggs and get away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course right away all the birds hurried over to sympathize with the
      Chebecs and to repeat against the unknown thief all the threats they had
      made against Blacky the Crow. They knew it couldn't have been Blacky this
      time because they had heard Blacky cawing over on the edge of the Green
      Forest. In the midst of the excited discussion as to who the thief was,
      Weaver the Orchard Oriole spied a blue and white feather on the ground
      just below Chebec's nest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Sammy Jay! There is no doubt about it, it was Sammy Jay!&rdquo; he
      cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sight of that telltale feather all the birds knew that Weaver was
      right, and led by Scrapper the Kingbird they began a noisy search of the
      Old Orchard for the sly robber. But Sammy wasn't to be found, and they
      soon gave up the search, none daring to stay longer away from his own home
      lest something should happen there. Welcome and Mrs. Robin continued to
      cry mournfully, but little Mr. and Mrs. Chebec bore their trouble almost
      silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one thing about it,&rdquo; said Mr. Chebec to his sorrowful little
      wife, &ldquo;that egg of Sally Sly's went with the rest, and we won't have to
      raise that bothersome orphan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's true,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;There is no use crying over what can't be
      helped. It is a waste of time to sit around crying. Come on, Chebec, let's
      look for a place to build another nest. Next time I won't leave the eggs
      unwatched for a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Jenny Wren's tongue was fairly flying as she chattered to Peter
      Rabbit, who had come up in the midst of the excitement and of course had
      to know all about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blacky the Crow has a heart as black as his coat, and his cousin Sammy
      Jay isn't much better,&rdquo; declared Jenny. &ldquo;They belong to a family of
      robbers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; cried Peter. &ldquo;Do you mean to say that Blacky the Crow and
      Sammy Jay are cousins?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For goodness' sake, Peter!&rdquo; exclaimed Jenny, &ldquo;do you mean to say that you
      don't know that? Of course they're cousins. They don't look much alike,
      but they belong to the same family. I would expect almost anything bad of
      any one as black as Blacky the Crow. But how such a handsome fellow as
      Sammy Jay can do such dreadful things I don't understand. He isn't as bad
      as Blacky, because he does do a lot of good. He destroys a lot of
      caterpillars and other pests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are no sharper eyes anywhere than those of Sammy Jay, and I'll have
      to say this for him, that whenever he discovers any danger he always gives
      us warning. He has saved the lives of a good many of us feathered folks in
      this way. If it wasn't for this habit of stealing our eggs I wouldn't have
      a word to say against him, but at that, he isn't as bad as Blacky the
      Crow. They say Blacky does some good by destroying white grubs and some
      other harmful pests, but he's a regular cannibal, for he is just as fond
      of young birds as he is of eggs, and the harm he does in this way is more
      than the good he does in other ways. He's bold, black, and bad, if you ask
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Remembering her household duties, Jenny Wren disappeared inside her house
      in her usual abrupt fashion. Peter hung around for a while but finding no
      one who would take the time to talk to him he suddenly decided to go over
      to the Green Forest to look for some of his friends there. He had gone but
      a little way in the Green Forest when he caught a glimpse of a blue form
      stealing away through the trees. He knew it in an instant, for there is no
      one with such a coat but Sammy Jay. Peter glanced up in the tree from
      which Sammy had flown and there he saw a nest in a crotch halfway up. &ldquo;I
      wonder,&rdquo; thought Peter, &ldquo;if Sammy was stealing eggs there, or if that is
      his own nest.&rdquo; Then he started after Sammy as fast as he could go,
      lipperty-lipperty-lip. As he ran he happened to look back and was just in
      time to see Mrs. Jay slip on to the nest. Then Peter knew that he had
      discovered Sammy's home. He chuckled as he ran.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've found out your secret, Sammy Jay!&rdquo; cried Peter when at last he
      caught up with Sammy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I hope you'll be gentleman enough to keep it,&rdquo; grumbled Sammy,
      looking not at all pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied Peter with dignity. &ldquo;I wouldn't think of telling any
      one. My, what a handsome fellow you are, Sammy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sammy looked pleased. He is a little bit vain, is Sammy Jay. There is no
      denying that he is handsome. He is just a bit bigger than Welcome Robin.
      His back is grayish-blue. His tail is a bright blue crossed with little
      black bars and edged with white. His wings are blue with white and black
      bars. His throat and breast are a soft grayish-white, and he wears a
      collar of black. On his head he wears a pointed cap, a very convenient
      cap, for at times he draws it down so that it is not pointed at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you steal Mrs. Chebec's eggs?&rdquo; demanded Peter abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sammy didn't look the least bit put out. &ldquo;Because I like eggs,&rdquo; he replied
      promptly. &ldquo;If people will leave their eggs unguarded they must expect to
      lose them. How did you know I took those eggs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, Sammy; never mind. A little bird told me,&rdquo; retorted Peter
      mischievously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sammy opened his mouth for a sharp reply, but instead he uttered a cry of
      warning. &ldquo;Run, Peter! Run! Here comes Reddy Fox!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter dived headlong under a great pile of brush. There he was quite safe.
      While he waited for Reddy Fox to go away he thought about Sammy Jay. &ldquo;It's
      funny,&rdquo; he mused, &ldquo;how so much good and so much bad can be mixed together.
      Sammy Jay stole Chebec's eggs, and then he saved my life. I just know he
      would have done as much for Mr. and Mrs. Chebec, or for any other
      feathered neighbor. He can only steal eggs for a little while in the
      spring. I guess on the whole he does more good than harm. I'm going to
      think so anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter was quite right. Sammy Jay does do more good than harm.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII. Some Homes in the Green Forest.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Reddy Fox wasted very little time waiting for Peter Rabbit to come out
      from under that pile of brush where he had hidden at Sammy Jay's warning.
      After making some terrible threats just to try to frighten Peter, he
      trotted away to look for some Mice. Peter didn't mind those threats at
      all. He was used to them. He knew that he was safe where he was, and all
      he had to do was to stay there until Reddy should be so far away that it
      would be safe to come out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just to pass away the time Peter took a little nap. When he awoke he sat
      for a few minutes trying to make up his mind where to go and what to do
      next. From 'way over in the direction of the Old Pasture the voice of
      Blacky the Crow reached him. Peter pricked up his ears, then chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reddy Fox has gone back to the Old Pasture and Blacky has discovered him
      there,&rdquo; he thought happily. You see, he understood what Blacky was saying.
      To you or me Blacky would have been saying simply, &ldquo;Caw! Caw!&rdquo; But to all
      the little people of the Green Forest and Green Meadows within hearing he
      was shouting, &ldquo;Fox! Fox!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; thought Peter, &ldquo;where Blacky is nesting this year. Last year
      his nest was in a tall pine-tree not far from the edge of the Green
      Forest. I believe I'll run over there and see if he has a new nest near
      the old one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Peter scampered over to the tall pine in which was Blacky's old nest.
      As he sat with his head tipped back, staring up at it, it struck him that
      that nest didn't look so old, after all. In fact, it looked as if it had
      recently been fixed up quite like new. He was wondering about this and
      trying to guess what it meant, when Blacky himself alighted close to the
      edge of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something in his bill, though what it was Peter couldn't see.
      Almost at once a black head appeared above the edge of the nest and a
      black bill seized the thing which Blacky had brought. Then the head
      disappeared and Blacky silently flew away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As sure as I live,&rdquo; thought Peter, &ldquo;that was Mrs. Blacky, and Blacky
      brought her some food so that she would not have to leave those eggs she
      must have up there. He may be the black-hearted robber every one says he
      is, but he certainly is a good husband. He's a better husband than some
      others I know, of whom nothing but good is said. It just goes to show that
      there is some good in the very worst folks. Blacky is a sly old rascal.
      Usually he is as noisy as any one I know, but he came and went without
      making a sound. Now I think of it, I haven't once heard his voice near
      here this spring. I guess if Farmer Brown's boy could find this nest he
      would get even with Blacky for pulling up his corn. I know a lot of clever
      people, but no one quite so clever as Blacky the Crow. With all his
      badness I can't help liking him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Twice, while Peter watched, Blacky returned with food for Mrs. Blacky.
      Then, tired of keeping still so long, Peter decided to run over to a
      certain place farther in the Green Forest which was seldom visited by any
      one. It was a place Peter usually kept away from. It was pure curiosity
      which led him to go there now. The discovery that Blacky the Crow was
      using his old nest had reminded Peter that Redtail the Hawk uses his old
      nest year after year, and he wanted to find out if Redtail had come back
      to it this year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Halfway over to that lonesome place in the Green Forest a trim little bird
      flew up from the ground, hopped from branch to branch of a tree, walked
      along a limb, then from pure happiness threw back his head and cried,
      &ldquo;Teacher, teacher, teacher, teacher, teacher!&rdquo; each time a little louder
      than before. It was Teacher the Oven Bird.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his delight at seeing this old friend, Peter quite forgot Redtail the
      Hawk. &ldquo;Oh, Teacher!&rdquo; cried Peter. &ldquo;I'm so glad to see you again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Teacher stopped singing and looked down at Peter. &ldquo;If you are so glad why
      haven't you been over to see me before?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;I've been here for
      some time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter looked a little foolish. &ldquo;The truth is, Teacher,&rdquo; said he very
      humbly, &ldquo;I have been visiting the Old Orchard so much and learning so many
      things that this is the first chance I have had to come 'way over here in
      the Green Forest. You see, I have been learning a lot of things about you
      feathered folks, things I hadn't even guessed. There is something I wish
      you'd tell me, Teacher; will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends on what it is,&rdquo; replied Teacher, eyeing Peter a little
      suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is why you are called Oven Bird,&rdquo; said Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; asked Teacher. Then without waiting for a reply he added,
      &ldquo;It is because of the way Mrs. Teacher and I build our nest. Some people
      think it is like an oven and so they call us Oven Birds. I think that is a
      silly name myself, quite as silly as Golden Crowned Thrush, which is what
      some people call me. I'm not a Thrush. I'm not even related to the Thrush
      family. I'm a Warbler, a Wood Warbler.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Peter, looking at Teacher thoughtfully, &ldquo;they've given
      you that name because you are dressed something like the Thrushes. That
      olive-green coat, and white waistcoat all streaked and spotted with black,
      certainly does remind me of the Thrush family. If you were not so much
      smaller than any of the Thrushes I should almost think you were one
      myself. Why, you are not very much bigger than Chippy the Chipping
      Sparrow, only you've got longer legs. I suppose that's because you spend
      so much time on the ground. I think that just Teacher is the best name for
      you. No one who has once heard you could ever mistake you for any one
      else. By the way, Teacher, where did you say your nest is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't say,&rdquo; retorted Teacher. &ldquo;What's more, I'm not going to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't you at least tell me if it is in a tree?&rdquo; begged Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Teacher's eyes twinkled. &ldquo;I guess it won't do any harm to tell you that
      much,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;No, it isn't in a tree. It is on the ground and, if I do
      say it, it is as well hidden a nest as anybody can build. Oh, Peter, watch
      your step! Watch your step!&rdquo; Teacher fairly shrieked this warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter, who had just started to hop off to his right, stopped short in
      sheer astonishment. Just in front of him was a tiny mound of dead leaves,
      and a few feet beyond Mrs. Teacher was fluttering about on the ground as
      if badly hurt. Peter simply didn't know what to make of it. Once more he
      made a movement as if to hop. Teacher flew right down in front of him.
      &ldquo;You'll step on my nest!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter stared, for he didn't see any nest. He said as much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's under that little mound of leaves right in front of your feet!&rdquo;
       cried Teacher. &ldquo;I wasn't going to tell you, but I just had to or you
      certainly would have stepped on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Very carefully Peter walked around the little bunch of leaves and peered
      under them from the other side. There, sure enough, was a nest beneath
      them, and in it four speckled eggs. &ldquo;I won't tell a soul, Teacher. I
      promise you I won't tell a soul,&rdquo; declared Peter very earnestly. &ldquo;I
      understand now why you are called Oven Bird, but I still like the name
      Teacher best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Feeling that Mr. and Mrs. Teacher would feel easier in their minds if he
      left them, Peter said good-by and started on for the lonesome place in the
      Green Forest where he knew the old nest of Redtail the Hawk had been. As
      he drew near the place he kept sharp watch through the treetops for a
      glimpse of Redtail. Presently he saw him high in the blue sky, sailing
      lazily in big circles. Then Peter became very, very cautious. He tiptoed
      forward, keeping under cover as much as possible. At last, peeping out
      from beneath a little hemlock-tree, he could see Redtail's old nest. He
      saw right away that it was bigger than it had been when he saw it last.
      Suddenly there was a chorus of hungry cries and Peter saw Mrs. Redtail
      approaching with a Mouse in her claws. From where he sat he could see four
      funny heads stretched above the edge of the nest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Redtail is using his old nest again and has got a family already,&rdquo;
       exclaimed Peter. &ldquo;I guess this is no place for me. The sooner I get away
      from here the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then Redtail himself dropped down out of the blue, blue sky and
      alighted on a tree close at hand. Peter decided that the best thing he
      could do was to sit perfectly still where he was. He had a splendid view
      of Redtail, and he couldn't help but admire this big member of the Hawk
      family. The upper parts of his coat were a dark grayish-brown mixed with
      touches of chestnut color. The upper part of his breast was streaked with
      grayish-brown and buff, the lower part having but few streaks. Below this
      were black spots and bars ending in white. But it was the tail which Peter
      noticed most of all. It was a rich reddish-brown with a narrow black band
      near its end and a white tip. Peter understood at once why this big Hawk
      is called Redtail.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until Mr. and Mrs. Redtail had gone in quest of more food for
      their hungry youngsters that Peter dared steal away. As soon as he felt it
      safe to do so, he headed for home as fast as he could go,
      lipperty-lipperty-lip. He knew that he wouldn't feel safe until that
      lonesome place in the Green Forest was far behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet if the truth be known, Peter had less cause to worry than would have
      been the case had it been some other member of the Hawk family instead of
      Redtail. And while Redtail and his wife do sometimes catch some of their
      feathered and furred neighbors, and once in a while a chicken, they do
      vastly more good than harm.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX. A Maker of Thunder and a Friend in Black.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Peter Rabbit's intentions were of the best. Once safely away from that
      lonesome part of the Green Forest where was the home of Redtail the Hawk,
      he intended to go straight back to the dear Old Briar-patch. But he was
      not halfway there when from another direction in the Green Forest there
      came a sound that caused him to stop short and quite forget all about
      home. It was a sound very like distant thunder. It began slowly at first
      and then went faster and faster. Boom&mdash;Boom&mdash;Boom&mdash;Boom-Boom-Boom
      Boo-Boo-B-B-B-B-b-b-b-b-boom! It was like the long roll on a bass drum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter laughed right out. &ldquo;That's Strutter the Stuffed Grouse!&rdquo; he cried
      joyously. &ldquo;I had forgotten all about him. I certainly must go over and pay
      him a call and find out where Mrs. Grouse is. My, how Strutter can drum!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter promptly headed towards that distant thunder. As he drew nearer to
      it, it sounded louder and louder. Presently Peter stopped to try to locate
      exactly the place where that sound, which now was more than ever like
      thunder, was coming from. Suddenly Peter remembered something. &ldquo;I know
      just where he is,&rdquo; said he to himself. &ldquo;There's a big, mossy, hollow log
      over yonder, and I remember that Mrs. Grouse once told me that that is
      Strutter's thunder log.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Very, very carefully Peter stole forward, making no sound at all. At last
      he reached a place where he could peep out and see that big, mossy, hollow
      log. Sure enough, there was Strutter the Ruffed Grouse. When Peter first
      saw him he was crouched on one end of the log, a fluffy ball of
      reddish-brown, black and gray feathers. He was resting. Suddenly he
      straightened up to his full height, raised his tail and spread it until it
      was like an open fan above his back. The outer edge was gray, then came a
      broad band of black, followed by bands of gray, brown and black. Around
      his neck was a wonderful ruff of black. His reddish-brown wings were
      dropped until the tips nearly touched the log. His full breast rounded out
      and was buff color with black markings. He was of about the size of the
      little Bantam hens Peter had seen in Farmer Brown's henyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the most stately way you can imagine Strutter walked the length of that
      mossy log. He was a perfect picture of pride as he strutted very much like
      Tom Gobbler the big Turkey cock. When he reached the end of the log he
      suddenly dropped his tail, stretched himself to his full height and his
      wings began to beat, first slowly then faster and faster, until they were
      just a blur. They seemed to touch above his back but when they came down
      they didn't quite strike his sides. It was those fast moving wings that
      made the thunder. It was so loud that Peter almost wanted to stop his
      ears. When it ended Strutter settled down to rest and once more appeared
      like a ball of fluffy feathers. His ruff was laid flat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter watched him thunder several times and then ventured to show himself.
      &ldquo;Strutter, you are wonderful! simply wonderful!&rdquo; cried Peter, and he meant
      just what he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strutter threw out his chest proudly. &ldquo;That is just what Mrs. Grouse
      says,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I don't know of any better thunderer if I do say it
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speaking of Mrs. Grouse, where is she?&rdquo; asked Peter eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Attending to her household affairs, as a good housewife should,&rdquo; retorted
      Strutter promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean she has a nest and eggs?&rdquo; asked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strutter nodded. &ldquo;She has twelve eggs,&rdquo; he added proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Peter artfully, &ldquo;her nest is somewhere near here on the
      ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's on the ground, Peter, but as to where it is I am not saying a word.
      It may or it may not be near here. Do you want to hear me thunder again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course Peter said he did, and that was sufficient excuse for Strutter
      to show off. Peter stayed a while longer to gossip, but finding Strutter
      more interested in thundering than in talking, he once more started for
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really would like to know where that nest is,&rdquo; said he to himself as he
      scampered along. &ldquo;I suppose Mrs. Grouse has hidden it so cleverly that it
      is quite useless to look for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On his way he passed a certain big tree. All around the ground was
      carpeted with brown, dead leaves. There were no bushes or young trees
      there. Peter never once thought of looking for a nest. It was the last
      place in the world he would expect to find one. When he was well past the
      big tree there was a soft chuckle and from among the brown leaves right at
      the foot of that big tree a head with a pair of the brightest eyes was
      raised a little. Those eyes twinkled as they watched Peter out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn't see me at all,&rdquo; chuckled Mrs. Grouse, as she settled down once
      more. &ldquo;That is what comes of having a cloak so like the color of these
      nice brown leaves. He isn't the first one who has passed me without seeing
      me at all. It is better than trying to hide a nest, and I certainly am
      thankful to Old Mother Nature for the cloak she gave me. I wonder if every
      one of these twelve eggs will hatch. If they do, I certainly will have a
      family to be proud of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Peter hurried on in his usual happy-go-lucky fashion until he
      came to the edge of the Green Forest. Out on the Green Meadows just beyond
      he caught sight of a black form walking about in a stately way and now and
      then picking up something. It reminded him of Blacky the Crow, but he knew
      right away that it wasn't Blacky, because it was so much smaller, being
      not more than half as big.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Creaker the Grackle. He was one of the first to arrive this spring
      and I'm ashamed of myself for not having called on him,&rdquo; thought Peter, as
      he hopped out and started across the Green Meadows towards Creaker. &ldquo;What
      a splendid long tail he has. I believe Jenny Wren told me that he belongs
      to the Blackbird family. He looks so much like Blacky the Crow that I
      suppose this is why they call him Crow Blackbird.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then Creaker turned in such a way that the sun fell full on his head
      and back. &ldquo;Why! Why-ee!&rdquo; exclaimed Peter, rubbing his eyes with
      astonishment. &ldquo;He isn't just black! He's beautiful, simply beautiful, and
      I've always supposed he was just plain, homely black.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was true. Creaker the Grackle with the sun shining on him was truly
      beautiful. His head and neck, his throat and upper breast, were a shining
      blue-black, while his back was a rich, shining brassy-green. His wings and
      tail were much like his head and neck. As Peter watched it seemed as if
      the colors were constantly changing. This changing of colors is called
      iridescence. One other thing Peter noticed and this was that Creaker's
      eyes were yellow. Just at the moment Peter couldn't remember any other
      bird with yellow eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Creaker,&rdquo; cried Peter, &ldquo;I wonder if you know how handsome you are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad you think so,&rdquo; replied Creaker. &ldquo;I'm not at all vain, but there
      are mighty few birds I would change coats with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is&mdash;is&mdash;Mrs. Creaker dressed as handsomely as you are?&rdquo; asked
      Peter rather timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creaker shook his head. &ldquo;Not quite,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;She likes plain black
      better. Some of the feathers on her back shine like mine, but she says
      that she has no time to show off in the sun and to take care of fine
      feathers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is she now?&rdquo; asked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over home,&rdquo; replied Creaker, pulling a white grub out of the roots of the
      grass. &ldquo;We've got a nest over there in one of those pine-trees on the edge
      of the Green Forest and I expect any day now we will have four hungry
      babies to feed. I shall have to get busy then. You know I am one of those
      who believe that every father should do his full share in taking care of
      his family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad to hear you say it,&rdquo; declared Peter, nodding his head with
      approval quite as if he was himself the best of fathers, which he isn't at
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask you a very personal question, Creaker?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask as many questions as you like. I don't have to answer them unless I
      want to,&rdquo; retorted Creaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it true that you steal the eggs of other birds?&rdquo; Peter blurted the
      question out rather hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creaker's yellow eyes began to twinkle. &ldquo;That is a very personal
      question,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I won't go so far as to say I steal eggs, but I've
      found that eggs are very good for my constitution and if I find a nest
      with nobody around I sometimes help myself to the eggs. You see the owner
      might not come back and then those eggs would spoil, and that would be a
      pity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's no excuse at all,&rdquo; declared Peter. &ldquo;I believe you're no better
      than Sammy Jay and Blacky the Crow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Creaker chuckled, but he did not seem to be at all offended. Just then he
      heard Mrs. Creaker calling him and with a hasty farewell he spread his
      wings and headed for the Green Forest. Once in the air he seemed just
      plain black. Peter watched him out of sight and then once more headed for
      the dear Old Briar-patch.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX. A Fisherman Robbed.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Just out of curiosity, and because he possesses what is called the
      wandering foot, which means that he delights to roam about, Peter Rabbit
      had run over to the bank of the Big River. There were plenty of bushes,
      clumps of tall grass, weeds and tangles of vines along the bank of the Big
      River, so that Peter felt quite safe there. He liked to sit gazing out
      over the water and wonder where it all came from and where it was going
      and what, kept it moving.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was doing this very thing on this particular morning when he happened
      to glance up in the blue, blue sky. There he saw a broad-winged bird
      sailing in wide, graceful circles. Instantly Peter crouched a little lower
      in his hiding-place, for he knew this for a member of the Hawk family and
      Peter has learned by experience that the only way to keep perfectly safe
      when one of these hook-clawed, hook-billed birds is about is to keep out
      of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      So now he crouched very close to the ground and kept his eyes fixed on the
      big bird sailing so gracefully high up in the blue, blue sky over the Big
      River. Suddenly the stranger paused in his flight and for a moment
      appeared to remain in one place, his great wings heating rapidly to hold
      him there. Then those wings were closed and with a rush he shot down
      straight for the water, disappearing with a great splash. Instantly Peter
      sat up to his full height that he might see better.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Plunger the Osprey fishing, and I've nothing to fear from him,&rdquo; he
      cried happily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of the water, his great wings flapping, rose Plunger. Peter looked
      eagerly to see if he had caught a fish, but there was nothing in Plunger's
      great, curved claws. Either that fish had been too deep or had seen
      Plunger and darted away just in the nick of time. Peter had a splendid
      view of Plunger. He was just a little bigger than Redtail the Hawk. Above
      he was dark brown, his head and neck marked with white. His tail was
      grayish, crossed by several narrow dark bands and tipped with white. His
      under parts were white with some light brown spots on his breast. Peter
      could see clearly the great, curved claws which are Plunger's fishhooks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up, up, up he rose, going round and round in a spiral. When he was well up
      in the blue, blue sky, he began to sail again in wide circles as when
      Peter had first seen him. It wasn't long before he again paused and then
      shot down towards the water. This time he abruptly spread his great wings
      just before reaching the water so that he no more than wet his feet. Once
      more a fish had escaped him. But Plunger seemed not in the least
      discouraged. He is a true fisherman and every true fisherman possesses
      patience. Up again he spiraled until he was so high that Peter wondered
      how he could possibly see a fish so far below. You see, Peter didn't know
      that it is easier to see down into the water from high above it than from
      close to it. Then, too, there are no more wonderful eyes than those
      possessed by the members of the Hawk family. And Plunger the Osprey is a
      Hawk, usually called Fish Hawk.
    </p>
    <p>
      A third time Plunger shot down and this time, as in his first attempt, he
      struck the water with a great splash and disappeared. In an instant he
      reappeared, shaking the water from him in a silver spray and flapping
      heavily. This time Fetes could gee a great shining fish in his claws. It
      was heavy, as Peter could tell by the way in which Plunger flew. He headed
      towards a tall tree on the other bank of the Big River, there to enjoy his
      breakfast. He was not more than halfway there when Peter was startled by a
      harsh scream.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up to see a great bird, with wonderful broad wings, swinging in
      short circles about Plunger. His body and wings were dark brown, and his
      head was snowy white, as was his tail. His great hooked beak was yellow
      and his legs were yellow. Peter knew in an instant who it was. There could
      be no mistake. It was King Eagle, commonly known as Bald Head, though his
      head isn't bald at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter's eyes looked as if they would pop out of his head, for it was quite
      plain to him that King Eagle was after Plunger, and Peter didn't
      understand this at all. You see, he didn't understand what King Eagle was
      screaming. But Plunger did. King Eagle was screaming, &ldquo;Drop that fish!
      Drop that fish!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Plunger didn't intend to drop that fish if he could help himself. It was
      his fish. Hadn't he caught it himself? He didn't intend to give it up to
      any robber of the air, even though that robber was King Eagle himself,
      unless he was actually forced to. So Plunger began to dodge and twist and
      turn in the air, all the time mounting higher and higher, and all the time
      screaming harshly, &ldquo;Robber! Thief! I won't drop this fish! It's mine! It's
      mine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now the fish was heavy, so of course Plunger couldn't fly as easily and
      swiftly as if he were carrying nothing. Up, up he went, but all the time
      King Eagle went up with him, circling round him, screaming harshly, and
      threatening to strike him with those great cruel, curved claws. Peter
      watched them, so excited that he fairly danced. &ldquo;O, I do hope Plunger will
      get away from that big robber,&rdquo; cried Peter. &ldquo;He may be king of the air,
      but he is a robber just the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Plunger and King Eagle were now high in the air above the Big River.
      Suddenly King Eagle swung above Plunger and for an instant seemed to hold
      himself still there, just as Plunger had done before he had shot down into
      the water after that fish. There was a still harsher note in King Eagle's
      scream. If Peter had been near enough he would have seen a look of anger
      and determination in King Eagle's fierce, yellow eyes. Plunger saw it and
      knew what it meant. He knew that King Eagle would stand for no more
      fooling. With a cry of bitter disappointment and anger he let go of the
      big fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down, down, dropped the fish, shining in the sun like a bar of silver.
      King Eagle's wings half closed and he shot down like a thunderbolt. Just
      before the fish reached the water King Eagle struck it with his great
      claws, checked himself by spreading his broad wings and tail, and then in
      triumph flew over to the very tree towards which Plunger had started when
      he had caught the fish. There he leisurely made his breakfast, apparently
      enjoying it as much as if he had come by it honestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for poor Plunger, he shook himself, screamed angrily once or twice,
      then appeared to think that it was wisest to make the best of a bad matter
      and that there were more fish where that one had come from, for he once
      more began to sail in circles over the Big River, searching for a fish
      near the surface. Peter watched him until he saw him catch another fish
      and fly away with it in triumph. King Eagle watched him, too, but having
      had a good breakfast he was quite willing to let Plunger enjoy his catch
      in peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late that afternoon Peter visited the Old Orchard, for he just had to tell
      Jenny Wren all about what he had seen that morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;King Eagle is king simply because he is so big and fierce and strong,&rdquo;
       sputtered Jenny. &ldquo;He isn't kingly in his habits, not the least bit. He
      never hesitates to rob those smaller than himself, just as you saw him rob
      Plunger. He is very fond of fish, and once in a while he catches one for
      himself when Plunger isn't around to be robbed, but he isn't a very good
      fisherman, and he isn't the least bit fussy about his fish. Plunger eats
      only fresh fish which he catches himself, but King Eagle will eat dead
      fish which he finds on the shore. He doesn't seem to care how long they
      have been dead either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn't he eat anything but fish?&rdquo; asked Peter innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; retorted Jenny Wren, her eyes twinkling, &ldquo;I wouldn't advise you to
      run across the Green Meadows in sight of King Eagle. I am told he is very
      fond of Rabbit. In fact he is very fond of fresh meat of any kind. He even
      catches the babies of Lightfoot the Deer when he gets a chance. He is so
      swift of wing that even the members of the Duck family fear him, for he is
      especially fond of fat Duck. Even Honker the Goose is not safe from him.
      King he may he, but he rules only through fear. He is a white-headed old
      robber. The best thing I can say of him is that he takes a mate for life
      and is loyal and true to her as long as she lives, and that is a great
      many years. By the way, Peter, did you know that she is bigger than he is,
      and that the young during the first year after leaving their nest, are
      bigger than their parents and do not have white heads? By the time they
      get white heads they are the same size as their parents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's queer and its hard to believe,&rdquo; said Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is queer, but it is true just the same, whether you believe it or
      not,&rdquo; retorted Jenny Wren, and whisked out of sight into her home.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI. A Fishing Party.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Peter Rabbit sat on the edge of the Old Briar-patch trying to make up his
      mind whether to stay at home, which was the wise and proper thing to do,
      or to go call on some of the friends he had not yet visited. A sharp,
      harsh rattle caused him to look up to see a bird about a third larger than
      Welcome Robin, and with a head out of all proportion to the size of his
      body. He was flying straight towards the Smiling Pool, rattling harshly as
      he flew. The mere sound of his voice settled the matter for Peter. &ldquo;It's
      Rattles the Kingfisher,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I think I'll run over to the Smiling
      Pool and pay him my respects.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Peter started for the Smiling Pool as fast as his long legs could take
      him, lipperty-lipperty-lip. He had lost sight of Rattles the Kingfisher,
      and when he reached the back of the Smiling Pool he was in doubt which way
      to turn. It was very early in the morning and there was not so much as a
      ripple on the surface of the Smiling Pool. As Peter sat there trying to
      make up his mind which way to go, he saw coming from the direction of the
      Big River a great, broad-winged bird, flying slowly. He seemed to have no
      neck at all, but carried straight out behind him were two long legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Longlegs the Great Blue Heron! I wonder if he is coming here,&rdquo; exclaimed
      Peter. &ldquo;I do hope so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter stayed right where he was and waited. Nearer and nearer came
      Longlegs. When he was right opposite Peter he suddenly dropped his long
      legs, folded his great wings, and alighted right on the edge of the
      Smiling Pool across from where Peter was sitting. If he seemed to have no
      neck at all when he was flying, now he seemed to be all neck as he
      stretched it to its full length. The fact is, his neck was so long that
      when he was flying he carried it folded back on his shoulders. Never
      before had Peter had such an opportunity to see Longlegs.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood quite four feet high. The top of his head and throat were white.
      From the base of his great bill and over his eye was a black stripe which
      ended in two long, slender, black feathers hanging from the back of his
      head. His bill was longer than his head, stout and sharp like a spear and
      yellow in color. His long neck was a light brownish-gray. His back and
      wings were of a bluish color. The bend of each wing and the feathered
      parts of his legs were a rusty-red. The remainder of his legs and his feet
      were black. Hanging down over his breast were beautiful long pearly-gray
      feathers quite unlike any Peter had seen on any of his other feathered
      friends. In spite of the length of his legs and the length of his neck he
      was both graceful and handsome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what has brought him over to the Smiling Pool,&rdquo; thought Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He didn't have to wait long to find out. After standing perfectly still
      with his neck stretched to its full height until he was sure that no
      danger was near, Longlegs waded into the water a few steps, folded his
      neck back on his shoulders until his long bill seemed to rest on his
      breast, and then remained as motionless as if there were no life in him.
      Peter also sat perfectly still. By and by he began to wonder if Longlegs
      had gone to sleep. His own patience was reaching an end and he was just
      about to go on in search of Rattles the Kingfisher when like a flash the
      dagger-like bill of Longlegs shot out and down into the water. When he
      withdrew it Peter saw that Longlegs had caught a little fish which he at
      once proceeded to swallow head-first. Peter almost laughed right out as he
      watched the funny efforts of Longlegs to gulp that fish down his long
      throat. Then Longlegs resumed his old position as motionless as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was no trouble now for Peter to sit still, for he was too interested in
      watching this lone fisherman to think of leaving. It wasn't long before
      Longlegs made another catch and this time it was a fat Pollywog. Peter
      thought of how he had watched Plunger the Osprey fishing in the Big River
      and the difference in the ways of the two fishermen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plunger hunts for his fish while Longlegs waits for his fish to come to
      him,&rdquo; thought Peter. &ldquo;I wonder if Longlegs never goes hunting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As if in answer to Peter's thought Longlegs seemed to conclude that no
      more fish were coming his way. He stretched himself up to his full height,
      looked sharply this way and that way to make sure that all was safe, then
      began to walk along the edge of the Smiling Pool. He put each foot down
      slowly and carefully so as to make no noise. He had gone but a few steps
      when that great bill darted down like a flash, and Peter saw that he had
      caught a careless young Frog. A few steps farther on he caught another
      Pollywog. Then coming to a spot that suited him, he once more waded in and
      began to watch for fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter was suddenly reminded of Rattles the Kingfisher, whom he had quite
      forgotten. From the Big Hickory-tree on the bank, Rattles flew out over
      the Smiling Pool, hovered for an instant, then plunged down head-first.
      There was a splash, and a second later Rattles was in the air again,
      shaking the water from him in a silver spray. In his long, stout, black
      bill was a little fish. He flew back to a branch of the Big Hickory-tree
      that hung out over the water and thumped the fish against the branch until
      it was dead. Then he turned it about so he could swallow it head-first. It
      was a big fish for the size of the fisherman and he had a dreadful time
      getting it down. But at last it was down, and Rattles set himself to watch
      for another. The sun shone full on him, and Peter gave a little gasp of
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never knew before how handsome Rattles is,&rdquo; thought Peter. He was about
      the size of Yellow Wing the Flicker, but his head made him look bigger
      than he really was. You see, the feathers on top of his head stood up in a
      crest, as if they had been brushed the wrong way. His head, back, wings
      and tail were a bluish-gray. His throat was white and he wore a white
      collar. In front of each eye was a little white spot. Across his breast
      was a belt of bluish-gray, and underneath he was white. There were tiny
      spots of white on his wings, and his tail was spotted with white. His bill
      was black and, like that of Longlegs, was long, and stout, and sharp. It
      looked almost too big for his size.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Rattles flew out and plunged into the Smiling Pool again, this
      time, very near to where Longlegs was patiently waiting. He caught a fish,
      for it is not often that Rattles misses. It was smaller than the first one
      Peter had seen him catch, and this time as soon as he got back to the Big
      Hickory-tree, he swallowed it without thumping it against the branch. As
      for Longlegs, he looked thoroughly put out. For a moment or two he stood
      glaring angrily up at Rattles. You see, when Rattles had plunged so close
      to Longlegs he had frightened all the fish. Finally Longlegs seemed to
      make up his mind that there was room for but one fisherman at a time at
      the Smiling Pool. Spreading his great wings, folding his long neck back on
      his shoulders, and dragging his long legs out behind him, he flew heavily
      away in the direction of the Big River.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rattles remained long enough to catch another little fish, and then with a
      harsh rattle flew off down the Laughing Brook. &ldquo;I would know him anywhere
      by that rattle,&rdquo; thought Peter. &ldquo;There isn't any one who can make a noise
      anything like it. I wonder where he has gone to now. He must have a nest,
      but I haven't the least idea what kind of a nest he builds. Hello! There's
      Grandfather Frog over on his green lily pad. Perhaps he can tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Peter hopped along until he was near enough to talk to Grandfather
      Frog. &ldquo;What kind of a nest does Rattles the Kingfisher build?&rdquo; repeated
      Grandfather Frog. &ldquo;Chug-arum, Peter Rabbit! I thought everybody knew that
      Rattles doesn't build a nest. At least I wouldn't call it a nest. He lives
      in a hole in the ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Peter, and looked as if he couldn't believe his own ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandfather Frog grinned and his goggly eyes twinkled. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he,
      &ldquo;Rattles lives in a hole in the ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;but what kind of a hole?&rdquo; stammered Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just plain hole,&rdquo; retorted Grandfather Frog, grinning more broadly than
      ever. Then seeing how perplexed and puzzled Peter looked, he went on to
      explain. &ldquo;He usually picks out a high gravelly bank close to the water and
      digs a hole straight in just a little way from the top. He makes it just
      big enough for himself and Mrs. Rattles to go in and out of comfortably,
      and he digs it straight in for several feet. I'm told that at the end of
      it he makes a sort of bedroom, because he usually has a good-sized
      family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say that he digs it himself?&rdquo; asked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandfather Frog nodded. &ldquo;If he doesn't, Mrs. Kingfisher does,&rdquo; he
      replied. &ldquo;Those big bills of theirs are picks as well as fish spears. They
      loosen the sand with those and scoop it out with their feet. I've never
      seen the inside of their home myself, but I'm told that their bedroom is
      lined with fish bones. Perhaps you may call that a nest, but I don't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going straight down the Laughing Brook to look for that hole,&rdquo;
       declared Peter, and left in such a hurry that he forgot to be polite
      enough to say thank you to Grandfather Frog.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII. Some Feathered Diggers.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Peter Rabbit scampered along down one bank of the Laughing Brook, eagerly
      watching for a high, gravelly bank such as Grandfather Frog had said that
      Rattles the Kingfisher likes to make his home in. If Peter had stopped to
      do a little thinking, he would have known that he was simply wasting time.
      You see, the Laughing Brook was flowing through the Green Meadows, so of
      course there would be no high, gravelly bank, because the Green Meadows
      are low. But Peter Rabbit, in his usual heedless way, did no thinking. He
      had seen Rattles fly down the Laughing Brook, and so he had just taken it
      for granted that the home of Rattles must be somewhere down there.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Peter reached the place where the Laughing Brook entered the Big
      River. Of course he hadn't found the home of Rattles. But now he did find
      something that for the time being made him quite forget Rattles and his
      home. Just before it reached the Big River the Laughing Brook wound
      through a swamp in which were many tall trees and a great number of young
      trees. A great many big ferns grew there and were splendid to hide under.
      Peter always did like that swamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had stopped to rest in a clump of ferns when he was startled by seeing
      a great bird alight in a tree just a little way from him. His first
      thought was that it was a Hawk, so you can imagine how surprised and
      pleased he was to discover that it was Mrs. Longlegs. Somehow Peter had
      always thought of Longlegs the Blue Heron as never alighting anywhere
      except on the ground. But here was Mrs. Longlegs in a tree. Having nothing
      to fear, Peter crept out from his hiding place that he might see better.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the tree in which Mrs. Longlegs was perched and just below her he saw a
      little platform of sticks. He didn't suspect that it was a nest, because
      it looked too rough and loosely put together to be a nest. Probably he
      wouldn't have thought about it at all had not Mrs. Longlegs settled
      herself on it right while Peter was watching. It didn't seem big enough or
      strong enough to hold her, but it did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I live,&rdquo; thought Peter, &ldquo;I've found the nest of Longlegs! He and Mrs.
      Longlegs may be good fishermen but they certainly are mighty poor
      nest-builders. I don't see how under the sun Mrs. Longlegs ever gets on
      and off that nest without kicking the eggs out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter sat around for a while, but as he didn't care to let his presence be
      known, and as there was no one to talk to, he presently made up his mind
      that being so near the Big River he would go over there to see if Plunger
      the Osprey was fishing again on this day.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached the Big River, Plunger was not in sight. Peter was
      disappointed. He had just about made up his mind to return the way he had
      come, when from beyond the swamp, farther up the Big River, he heard the
      harsh, rattling cry of Rattles the Kingfisher. It reminded him of what he
      had come for, and he at once began to hurry in that direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter came out of the swamp on a little sandy beach. There he squatted for
      a moment, blinking his eyes, for out there the sun was very bright. Then a
      little way beyond him he discovered something that in his eager curiosity
      made him quite forget that he was out in the open where it was anything
      but safe for a Rabbit to be. What he saw was a high sandy bank. With a
      hasty glance this way and that way to make sure that no enemy was in
      sight, Peter scampered along the edge of the water till he was right at
      the foot of that sandy bank. Then he squatted down and looked eagerly for
      a hole such as he imagined Rattles the Kingfisher might make. Instead of
      one hole he saw a lot of holes, but they were very small holes. He knew
      right away that Rattles couldn't possibly get in or out of a single one of
      those holes. In fact, those holes in the bank were no bigger than the
      holes Downy the Woodpecker makes in trees. Peter couldn't imagine who or
      what had made them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Peter sat there staring and wondering a trim little head appeared at
      the entrance to one of those holes. It was a trim little head with a very
      small bill and a snowy white throat. At first glance Peter thought it was
      his old friend, Skimmer the Tree Swallow, and he was just on the point of
      asking what under the sun Skimmer was doing in such a place as that, when
      with a lively twitter of greeting the owner of that little hole in the
      bank flew out and circled over Peter's head. It wasn't Skimmer at all. It
      was Banker the Bank Swallow, own cousin to Skimmer the Tree Swallow. Peter
      recognized him the instant he got a full view of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place Banker was a little smaller than Skimmer. Then too, he
      was not nearly so handsome. His back, instead of being that beautiful rich
      steel-blue which makes Skimmer so handsome, was a sober grayish-brown. He
      was a little darker on his wings and tail. His breast, instead of being
      all snowy white, was crossed with a brownish band. His tail was more
      nearly square across the end than is the case with other members of the
      Swallow family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wha&mdash;wha&mdash;what were you doing there?&rdquo; stuttered Peter, his eyes
      popping right out with curiosity and excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that's my home,&rdquo; twittered Banker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do&mdash;do&mdash;do you mean to say that you live in a hole in the
      ground?&rdquo; cried Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; why not?&rdquo; twittered Banker as he snapped up a fly just over
      Peter's head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know any reason why you shouldn't,&rdquo; confessed Peter. &ldquo;But somehow
      it is hard for me to think of birds as living in holes in the ground. I've
      only just found out that Rattles the Kingfisher does. But I didn't suppose
      there were any others. Did you make that hole yourself, Banker?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; replied Banker. &ldquo;That is, I helped make it. Mrs. Banker did
      her share. 'Way in at the end of it we've got the nicest little nest of
      straw and feathers. What is more, we've got four white eggs in there, and
      Mrs. Banker is sitting on them now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time the air seemed to be full of Banker's friends, skimming and
      circling this way and that, and going in and out of the little holes in
      the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am like my big cousin, Twitter the Purple Martin, fond of society,&rdquo;
       explained Banker. &ldquo;We Bank Swallows like our homes close together. You
      said that you had just learned that Rattles the Kingfisher has his home in
      a bank. Do you know where it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Peter. &ldquo;I was looking for it when I discovered your home.
      Can you tell me where it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll do better than that;&rdquo; replied Banker. &ldquo;I'll show you where it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He darted some distance up along the bank and hovered for an instant close
      to the top. Peter scampered over there and looked up. There, just a few
      inches below the top, was another hole, a very much larger hole than those
      he had just left. As he was staring up at it a head with a long sharp bill
      and a crest which looked as if all the feathers on the top of his head had
      been brushed the wrong way, was thrust out. It was Rattles himself. He
      didn't seem at all glad to see Peter. In fact, he came out and darted at
      Peter angrily. Peter didn't wait to feel that sharp dagger-like bill. He
      took to his heels. He had seen what he started out to find and he was
      quite content to go home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter took a short cut across the Green Meadows. It took him past a
      certain tall, dead tree. A sharp cry of &ldquo;Kill-ee, kill-ee, kill-ee!&rdquo;
       caused Peter to look up just in time to see a trim, handsome bird whose
      body was about the size of Sammy Jay's but whose longer wings and longer
      tail made him look bigger. One glance was enough to tell Peter that this
      was a member of the Hawk family, the smallest of the family. It was Killy
      the Sparrow Hawk. He is too small for Peter to fear him, so now Peter was
      possessed of nothing more than a very lively curiosity, and sat up to
      watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out over the meadow grass Killy sailed. Suddenly, with beating wings, he
      kept himself in one place in the air and then dropped down into the grass.
      He was up again in an instant, and Peter could see that he had a fat
      grasshopper in his claws. Back to the top of the tall, dead tree he flew
      and there ate the grasshopper. When it was finished he sat up straight and
      still, so still that he seemed a part of the tree itself. With those
      wonderful eyes of his he was watching for another grasshopper or for a
      careless Meadow Mouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very trim and handsome was Killy. His back was reddish-brown crossed by
      bars of black. His tail was reddish-brown with a band of black near its
      end and a white tip. His wings were slaty-blue with little bars of black,
      the longest feathers leaving white bars. Underneath he was a beautiful
      buff, spotted with black. His head was bluish with a reddish patch right
      on top. Before and behind each ear was a black mark. His rather short
      bill, like the bills of all the rest of his family, was hooked.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Peter sat there admiring Killy, for he was handsome enough for any one
      to admire, he noticed for the first time a hole high up in the trunk of
      the tree, such a hole as Yellow Wing the Flicker might have made and
      probably did make. Right away Peter remembered what Jenny Wren had told
      him about Killy's making his nest in just such a hole. &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; thought
      Peter, &ldquo;if that is Killy's home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then Killy flew over and dropped in the grass just in front of Peter,
      where he caught another fat grasshopper. &ldquo;Is that your home up there?&rdquo;
       asked Peter hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It certainly is, Peter,&rdquo; replied Killy. &ldquo;This is the third summer Mrs.
      Killy and I have had our home there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to be very fond of grasshoppers,&rdquo; Peter ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; replied Killy. &ldquo;They are very fine eating when one can get enough
      of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they the only kind of food you eat?&rdquo; ventured Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Killy laughed. It was a shrill laugh. &ldquo;I should say not,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I eat
      spiders and worms and all sorts of insects big enough to give a fellow a
      decent bite. But for real good eating give me a fat Meadow Mouse. I don't
      object to a Sparrow or some other small bird now and then, especially when
      I have a family of hungry youngsters to feed. But take it the season
      through, I live mostly on grasshoppers and insects and Meadow Mice. I do a
      lot of good in this world, I'd have you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter said that he supposed that this was so, but all the time he kept
      thinking what a pity it was that Killy ever killed his feathered
      neighbors. As soon as he conveniently could he politely bade Killy good-by
      and hurried home to the dear Old Briar-patch, there to think over how
      queer it seemed that a member of the hawk family should nest in a hollow
      tree and a member of the Swallow family should dig a hole in the ground.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII. Some Big Mouths.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Boom! Peter Rabbit jumped as if he had been shot. It was all so sudden and
      unexpected that Peter jumped before he had time to think. Then he looked
      foolish. He felt foolish. He had been scared when there was nothing to be
      afraid of.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, ha, ha, ha,&rdquo; tittered Jenny Wren. &ldquo;What are you jumping for, Peter
      Rabbit? That was only Boomer the Nighthawk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it just as well as you do, Jenny Wren,&rdquo; retorted Peter rather
      crossly. &ldquo;You know being suddenly startled is apt to make people feel
      cross. If I had seen him anywhere about he wouldn't have made me jump. It
      was the unexpectedness of it. I don't see what he is out now for, anyway,
      It isn't even dusk yet, and I thought him a night bird.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he is,&rdquo; retorted Jenny Wren. &ldquo;Anyway, he is a bird of the evening, and
      that amounts to the same thing. But just because he likes the evening best
      isn't any reason why he shouldn't come out in the daylight, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-o,&rdquo; replied Peter rather slowly. &ldquo;I don't suppose it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it isn't,&rdquo; declared Jenny Wren. &ldquo;I see Boomer late in the
      afternoon nearly every day. On cloudy days I often see him early in the
      afternoon. He's a queer fellow, is Boomer. Such a mouth as he has! I
      suppose it is very handy to have a big mouth if one must catch all one's
      food in the air, but it certainly isn't pretty when it is wide open.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never saw a mouth yet that was pretty when it was wide open,&rdquo; retorted
      Peter, who was still feeling a little put out. &ldquo;I've never noticed that
      Boomer has a particularly big mouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well he has, whether you've noticed it or not,&rdquo; retorted Jenny Wren
      sharply. &ldquo;He's got a little bit of a bill, but a great big mouth. I don't
      see what folks call him a Hawk for when he isn't a Hawk at all. He is no
      more of a Hawk than I am, and goodness knows I'm not even related to the
      Hawk family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you told me the other day that Boomer is related to Sooty the
      Chimney Swift,&rdquo; said Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jenny nodded vigorously. &ldquo;So I did, Peter,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I'm glad you
      have such a good memory. Boomer and Sooty are sort of second cousins.
      There is Boomer now, way up in the sky. I do wish he'd dive and scare some
      one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter tipped his head 'way back. High up in the blue, blue sky was a bird
      which at that distance looked something like a much overgrown Swallow. He
      was circling and darting about this way and that. Even while Peter watched
      he half closed his wings and shot down with such speed that Peter actually
      held his breath. It looked very, very much as if Boomer would dash himself
      to pieces. Just before he reached the earth he suddenly opened those wings
      and turned upward. At the instant he turned, the booming sound which had
      so startled Peter was heard. It was made by the rushing of the wind
      through the larger feathers of his wings as he checked himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this dive Boomer had come near enough for Peter to get a good look at
      him. His coat seemed to be a mixture of brown and gray, very soft looking.
      His wings were brown with a patch of white on each. There was a white
      patch on his throat and a band of white near the end of his tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's rather handsome, don't you think?&rdquo; asked Jenny Wren.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He certainly is,&rdquo; replied Peter. &ldquo;Do you happen to know what kind of a
      nest the Nighthawks build, Jenny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They don't build any.&rdquo; Jenny Wren was a picture of scorn as she said
      this. &ldquo;They don't built any nests at all. It can't be because they are
      lazy for I don't know of any birds that hunt harder for their living than
      do Boomer and Mrs. Boomer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if there isn't any nest where does Mrs. Boomer lay her eggs?&rdquo; cried
      Peter. &ldquo;I think you must be mistaken, Jenny Wren. They must have some kind
      of a nest. Of course they must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't I say they don't have a nest?&rdquo; sputtered Jenny. &ldquo;Mrs. Nighthawk
      doesn't lay but two eggs, anyway. Perhaps she thinks it isn't worth while
      building a nest for just two eggs. Anyway, she lays them on the ground or
      on a flat rock and lets it go at that. She isn't quite as bad as Sally Sly
      the Cowbird, for she does sit on those eggs and she is a good mother. But
      just think of those Nighthawk children never having any home! It doesn't
      seem to me right and it never will. Did you ever see Boomer in a tree?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter shook his head. &ldquo;I've seen him on the ground,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but I never
      have seen him in a tree. Why did you ask, Jenny Wren?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To find out how well you have used your eyes,&rdquo; snapped Jenny. &ldquo;I just
      wanted to see if you had noticed anything peculiar about the way he sits
      in a tree. But as long as you haven't seen him in a tree I may as well
      tell you that he doesn't sit as most birds do. He sits lengthwise of a
      branch. He never sits across it as the rest of us do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How funny!&rdquo; exclaimed Peter. &ldquo;I suppose that is Boomer making that queer
      noise we hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Jenny. &ldquo;He certainly does like to use his voice. They tell
      me that some folks call him Bullbat, though why they should call him
      either Bat or Hawk is beyond me. I suppose you know his cousin,
      Whip-poor-will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say I do,&rdquo; replied Peter. &ldquo;He's enough to drive one crazy when
      he begins to shout 'Whip poor Will' close at hand. That voice of his goes
      through me so that I want to stop both ears. There isn't a person of my
      acquaintance who can say a thing over and over, over and over, so many
      times without stopping for breath. Do I understand that he is cousin to
      Boomer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a sort of second cousin, the same as Sooty the Chimney Swift,&rdquo;
       explained Jenny Wren. &ldquo;They look enough alike to be own cousins.
      Whip-poor-will has just the same kind of a big mouth and he is dressed
      very much like Boomer, save that there are no white patches on his wings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've noticed that,&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;That is one way I can tell them apart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you noticed that much, did you?&rdquo; cried Jenny. &ldquo;It does you credit,
      Peter. It does you credit. I wonder if you also noticed Whip-poor-will's
      whiskers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whiskers!&rdquo; cried Peter. &ldquo;Who ever heard of a bird having whiskers? You
      can stuff a lot down me, Jenny Wren, but there are some things I cannot
      swallow, and bird whiskers is one of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody asked you to swallow them. Nobody wants you to swallow them,&rdquo;
       snapped Jenny. &ldquo;I don't know why a bird shouldn't have whiskers just as
      well as you, Peter Rabbit. Anyway, Whip-poor-will has them and that is all
      there is to it. It doesn't make any difference whether you believe in them
      or not, they are there. And I guess Whip-poor-will finds them just as
      useful as you find yours, and a little more so. I know this much, that if
      I had to catch all my food in the air I'd want whiskers and lots of them
      so that the insects would get tangled in them. I suppose that's what
      Whip-poor-will's are for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, Jenny Wren,&rdquo; said Peter very humbly. &ldquo;Of course
      Whip-poor-will has whiskers if you say so. By the way, do the
      Whip-poor-wills do any better in the matter of a nest than the
      Nighthawks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; replied Jenny Wren. &ldquo;Mrs. Whip-poor-will lays her eggs right
      on the ground, but usually in the Green Forest where it is dark and
      lonesome. Like Mrs. Nighthawk, she lays only two. It's the same way with
      another second cousin, Chuck-will's-widow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; cried Peter, wrinkling his brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chuck-will's-widow,&rdquo; Jenny Wren fairly shouted it. &ldquo;Don't you know
      Chuck-will's-widow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter shook his head. &ldquo;I never heard of such a bird,&rdquo; he confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what comes of never having traveled,&rdquo; retorted Jenny Wren. &ldquo;If
      you'd ever been in the South the way I have you would know
      Chuck-will's-widow. He looks a whole lot like the other two we've been
      talking about, but has even a bigger mouth. What's more, he has whiskers
      with branches. Now you needn't look as if you doubted that, Peter Rabbit;
      it's so. In his habits he's just like his cousins, no nest and only two
      eggs. I never saw people so afraid to raise a real family. If the Wrens
      didn't do better than that, I don't know what would become of us.&rdquo; You
      know Jenny usually has a family of six or eight.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV. The Warblers Arrive.
    </h2>
    <p>
      If there is one family of feathered friends which perplexes Peter Rabbit
      more than another, it is the Warbler family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So many of them come together and they move about so constantly that a
      fellow doesn't have a chance to look at one long enough to recognize him,&rdquo;
       complained Peter to Jenny Wren one morning when the Old Orchard was fairly
      alive with little birds no bigger than Jenny Wren herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      And such restless little folks as they were!
    </p>
    <p>
      They were not still an instant, flitting from tree to tree, twig to twig,
      darting out into the air and all the time keeping up an endless chattering
      mingled with little snatches of song. Peter would no sooner fix his eyes
      on one than another entirely different in appearance would take its place.
      Occasionally he would see one whom he recognized, one who would stay for
      the nesting season. But the majority of them would stop only for a day or
      two, being bound farther north to make their summer homes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently, Jenny Wren did not look upon them altogether with favor.
      Perhaps Jenny was a little bit envious, for compared with the bright
      colors of some of them Jenny was a very homely small person indeed. Then,
      too, there were so many of them and they were so busy catching all kinds
      of small insects that it may be Jenny was a little fearful they would not
      leave enough for her to get her own meals easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see what they have to stop here for,&rdquo; scolded Jenny. &ldquo;They could
      just as well go somewhere else where they would not be taking the food out
      of the mouths of honest folk who are here to stay all summer. Did you ever
      in your life see such uneasy people? They don't keep still an instant. It
      positively makes me tired just to watch them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter couldn't help but chuckle, for Jenny Wren herself is a very restless
      and uneasy person. As for Peter, he was thoroughly enjoying this visit of
      the Warblers, despite the fact that he was having no end of trouble trying
      to tell who was who. Suddenly one darted down and snapped up a fly almost
      under Peter's very nose and was back up in a tree before Peter could get
      his breath. &ldquo;It's Zee Zee the Redstart!&rdquo; cried Peter joyously. &ldquo;I would
      know Zee Zee anywhere. Do you know who he reminds me of, Jenny Wren?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; demanded Jenny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goldy the Oriole,&rdquo; replied Peter promptly. &ldquo;Only of course he's ever and
      ever so much smaller. He's all black and orange-red and white something as
      Goldy is, only there isn't quite so much orange on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For just an instant Zee Zee sat still with his tail spread. His head,
      throat and back were black and there was a black band across the end of
      his tail and a black stripe down the middle of it. The rest was bright
      orange-red. On each wing was a band of orange-red and his sides were the
      same color. Underneath he was white tinged more or less with orange.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only for an instant that Zee Zee sat still; then he was in the air,
      darting, diving, whirling, going through all sorts of antics as he caught
      tiny insects too small for Peter to see. Peter began to wonder how he kept
      still long enough to sleep at night. And his voice was quite as busy as
      his wings. &ldquo;Zee, zee, zee, zee!&rdquo; he would cry. But this was only one of
      many notes. At times he would sing a beautiful little song and then again
      it would seem as if he were trying to imitate other members of the Warbler
      family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do hope Zee Zee is going to stay here,&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;I just love to
      watch him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll stay fast enough,&rdquo; retorted Jenny Wren. &ldquo;I don't imagine he'll stay
      in the Old Orchard and I hope he won't, because if he does it will make it
      just that much harder for me to catch enough to feed my big family.
      Probably he and Mrs. Redstart will make their home on the edge of the
      Green Forest. They like it better over there, for which I am thankful.
      There's Mrs Redstart now. Just notice that where Zee Zee is bright
      orange-y red she is yellow, and instead of a black head she has a gray
      head and her back is olive-green with a grayish tinge. She isn't nearly as
      handsome as Zee Zee, but then, that's not to be expected. She lets Zee Zee
      do the singing and the showing off and she does the work. I expect she'll
      build that nest with almost no help at all from him. But Zee Zee is a good
      father, I'll say that much for him. He'll do his share in feeding their
      babies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then Peter caught sight of a bird all in yellow. He was about the
      same size as Zee Zee and was flitting about among the bushes along the old
      stone wall. &ldquo;There's Sunshine!&rdquo; cried Peter, and without being polite
      enough to even bid Jenny Wren farewell, he scampered over to where he
      could see the one he called Sunshine flitting about from bush to bush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Sunshine!&rdquo; he cried, as he came within speaking distance, &ldquo;I'm ever
      and ever so glad to see you back. I do hope you and Mrs. Sunshine are
      going to make your home somewhere near here where I can see you every
      day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Peter! I am just as glad to see you as you are to see me,&rdquo; cried
      Sunshine the Yellow Warbler. &ldquo;Yes, indeed, we certainly intend to stay
      here if we can find just the right place for our nest. It is lovely to be
      back here again. We've journeyed so far that we don't want to go a bit
      farther if we can help it. Have you seen Sally Sly the Cowbird around here
      this spring?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter nodded. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry to hear it,&rdquo; declared Sunshine. &ldquo;She made us a lot of trouble
      last year. But we fooled her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you fool her?&rdquo; asked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sunshine paused to pick a tiny worm from a leaf. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;she
      found our nest just after we had finished it and before Mrs. Sunshine had
      had a chance to lay an egg. Of course you know what she did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can guess,&rdquo; replied Peter. &ldquo;She laid one of her own eggs in your nest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sunshine stopped to pick two or three more worms from the leaves. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
       said he. &ldquo;She did just that, the lazy good-for-nothing creature! But it
      didn't do her a bit of good, not a bit. That egg never hatched. We fooled
      her and that's what we'll do again if she repeats that trick this year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you do, throw that egg out?&rdquo; asked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Sunshine. &ldquo;Our nest was too deep for us to get that egg out.
      We just made a second bottom in our nest right over that egg and built the
      sides of the nest a little higher. Then we took good care that she didn't
      have a chance to lay another egg in there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you had a regular two-story nest, didn't you?&rdquo; cried Peter, opening
      his eyes very wide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sunshine nodded. &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and it was a mighty fine nest, if I
      do say it. If there's anything Mrs. Sunshine and I pride ourselves on it
      is our nest. There are no babies who have a softer, cozier home than
      ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you make your nest of?&rdquo; asked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine grasses and soft fibers from plants, some hair when we can find it,
      and a few feathers. But we always use a lot of that nice soft fern-cotton.
      There is nothing softer or nicer that I know of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All the time Peter had been admiring Sunshine and thinking how wonderfully
      well he was named. At first glance he seemed to be all yellow, as if
      somehow he had managed to catch and hold the sunshine in his feathers.
      There wasn't a white feather on him. When he came very close Peter could
      see that on his breast and underneath were little streaks of reddish brown
      and his wings and tail were a little blackish. Otherwise he was all
      yellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he was joined by Mrs. Sunshine. She was not such a bright yellow
      as was Sunshine, having an olive-green tint on her back. But underneath
      she was almost clear yellow without the reddish-brown streaks. She too was
      glad to see Peter but couldn't stop to gossip, for already, as she
      informed Sunshine, she had found just the place for their nest. Of course
      Peter begged to be told where it was. But the two little folks in yellow
      snapped their bright eyes at him and told him that that was their secret
      and they didn't propose to tell a living soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps if Peter had not been so curious and eager to get acquainted with
      other members of the Warbler family he would have stayed and done a little
      spying. As it was, he promised himself to come back to look for that nest
      after it had been built; then he scurried back among the trees of the Old
      Orchard to look for other friends among the busy little Warblers who were
      making the Old Orchard such a lively place that morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's one thing about it,&rdquo; cried Peter. &ldquo;Any one can tell Zee Zee the
      Redstart by his black and flame colored suit. There is no other like it.
      And any one can tell Sunshine the Yellow Warbler because there isn't
      anybody else who seems to be all yellow. My, what a lively, lovely lot
      these Warblers are!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV. Three Cousins Quite Unlike.
    </h2>
    <p>
      As Peter Rabbit passed one of the apple-trees in the Old Orchard, a thin,
      wiry voice hailed him. &ldquo;It's a wonder you wouldn't at least say you're
      glad to see me back, Peter Rabbit,&rdquo; said the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter, who had been hopping along rather fast, stopped abruptly to look
      up. Running along a limb just over his head, now on top and now
      underneath, was a little bird with a black and white striped coat and a
      white waistcoat. Just as Peter looked it flew down to near the base of the
      tree and began to run straight up the trunk, picking things from the bark
      here and there as it ran. Its way of going up that tree trunk reminded
      Peter of one of his winter friends, Seep Seep the Brown Creeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It strikes me that this is a mighty poor welcome for one who has just
      come all the way from South America,&rdquo; said the little black and white bird
      with twinkling eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Creeper, I didn't know you were here!&rdquo; cried Peter. &ldquo;You know I'm
      glad to see you. I'm just as glad as glad can be. You are such a quiet
      fellow I'm afraid I shouldn't have seen you at all if you hadn't spoken.
      You know it's always been hard work for me to believe that you are really
      and truly a Warbler.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; demanded Creeper the Black and White Warbler, for that is the
      name by which he is commonly known. &ldquo;Why so? Don't I look like a Warbler?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye-es,&rdquo; said Peter slowly. &ldquo;You do look like one but you don't act like
      one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what way don't I act like one I should like to know?&rdquo; demanded
      Creeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Peter, &ldquo;all the rest of the Warblers are the uneasiest
      folks I know of. They can't seem to keep still a minute. They are
      everlastingly flitting about this way and that way and the other way. I
      actually get tired watching them. But you are not a bit that way. Then the
      way you run up tree trunks and along the limbs isn't a bit Warbler-like.
      Why don't you flit and dart about as the others do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Creeper's bright eyes sparkled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't have to,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I'm going to let you into a little secret,
      Peter. The rest of them get their living from the leaves and twigs and in
      the air, but I've discovered an easier way. I've found out that there are
      lots of little worms and insects and eggs on the trunks and big limbs of
      the trees and that I can get the best kind of a living there without
      flitting about everlastingly. I don't have to share them with anybody but
      the Woodpeckers, Nuthatches, and Tommy Tit the Chickadee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That reminds me,&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;Those folks you have mentioned nest in
      holes in trees; do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say not,&rdquo; retorted Creeper. &ldquo;I don't know of any Warbler who
      does. I build on the ground, if you want to know. I nest in the Green
      Forest. Sometimes I make my nest in a little hollow at the base of a tree;
      sometimes I put it under a stump or rock or tuck it in under the roots of
      a tree that has been blown over. But there, Peter Rabbit, I've talked
      enough. I'm glad you're glad that I'm back, and I'm glad I'm back too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Creeper continued on up the trunk of the tree, picking here and picking
      there. Just then Peter caught sight of another friend whom he could always
      tell by the black mask he wore. It was Mummer the Yellow-throat. He had
      just darted into the thicket of bushes along the old stone wall. Peter
      promptly hurried over there to look for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Peter reached the place where he had caught a glimpse of Mummer, no
      one was to be seen. Peter sat down, uncertain which way to go. Suddenly
      Mummer popped out right in front of Peter, seemingly from nowhere at all.
      His throat and breast were bright yellow and his back wings and tail a
      soft olive-green. But the most remarkable thing about him was the mask of
      black right across his cheeks, eyes and forehead. At least it looked like
      a mask, although it really wasn't one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Mummer!&rdquo; cried Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello yourself, Peter Rabbit!&rdquo; retorted Mummer and then disappeared as
      suddenly as he had appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter blinked and looked in vain all about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looking for some one?&rdquo; asked Mummer, suddenly popping into view where
      Peter least expected him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For goodness' sake, can't you sit still a minute?&rdquo; cried Peter. &ldquo;How do
      you expect a fellow can talk to you when he can't keep his eyes on you
      more than two seconds at a time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who asked you to talk to me?&rdquo; responded Mummer, and popped out of sight.
      Two seconds later he was back again and his bright little eyes fairly
      shone with mischief. Then before Peter could say a word Mummer burst into
      a pleasant little song. He was so full of happiness that Peter couldn't be
      cross with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's one thing I like about you, Mummer,&rdquo; declared Peter, &ldquo;and that is
      that I never get you mixed up with anybody else. I should know you just as
      far as I could see you because of that black mask across your face. Has
      Mrs. Yellow-throat arrived yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied another voice, and Mrs. Yellow-throat flitted across
      right in front of Peter. For just a second she sat still, long enough for
      him to have one good look at her. She was dressed very like Mummer save
      that she did not wear the black mask.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter was just about to say something polite and pleasant when from just
      back of him there sounded a loud, very emphatic, &ldquo;Chut! Chut!&rdquo; Peter
      whirled about to find another old friend. It was Chut-Chut the
      Yellow-breasted Chat, the largest of the Warbler family. He was so much
      bigger than Mummer that it was hard to believe that they were own cousins.
      But Peter knew they were, and he also knew that he could never mistake
      Chut-Chut for any other member of the family because of his big size,
      which was that of some of the members of the Sparrow family. His back was
      a dark olive-green, but his throat and breast were a beautiful bright
      yellow. There was a broad white line above each eye and a little white
      line underneath. Below his breast he was all white.
    </p>
    <p>
      To have seen him you would have thought that he suspected Peter might do
      him some harm. He acted that way. If Peter hadn't known him so well he
      might have been offended. But Peter knew that there is no one among his
      feathered friends more cautious than Chut-Chut the Chat. He never takes
      anything for granted. He appears to be always on the watch for danger,
      even to the extent of suspecting his very best friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had decided in his own mind that there was no danger, Chut-Chut
      came out for a little gossip. But like all the rest of the Warblers he
      couldn't keep still. Right in the middle of the story of his travels from
      far-away Mexico he flew to the top of a little tree, began to sing, then
      flew out into the air with his legs dangling and his tail wagging up and
      down in the funniest way, and there continued his song as he slowly
      dropped down into the thicket again. It was a beautiful song and Peter
      hastened to tell him so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chut-Chut was pleased. He showed it by giving a little concert all by
      himself. It seemed to Peter that he never had heard such a variety of
      whistles and calls and songs as came from that yellow throat. When it was
      over Chut-Chut abruptly said good-by and disappeared. Peter could hear his
      sharp &ldquo;Chut! Chut!&rdquo; farther along in the thicket as he hunted for worms
      among the bushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said Peter, speaking out loud without thinking, &ldquo;where he
      builds his nest. I wonder if he builds it on the ground, the way Creeper
      does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; declared Mummer, who all the time had been darting about close at
      hand. &ldquo;He doesn't, but I do. Chut-Chut puts his nest near the ground,
      however, usually within two or three feet. He builds it in bushes or
      briars. Sometimes if I can find a good tangle of briars I build my nest in
      it several feet from the ground, but as a rule I would rather have it on
      the ground under a bush or in a clump of weeds. Have you seen my cousin
      Sprite the Parula Warbler, yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; said Peter, as he started for home.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI. Peter Gets a Lame Neck.
    </h2>
    <p>
      For several days it seemed to Peter Rabbit that everywhere he went he
      found members of the Warbler family. Being anxious to know all of them he
      did his best to remember how each one looked, but there were so many and
      some of them were dressed so nearly alike that after awhile Peter became
      so mixed that he gave it up as a bad job. Then, as suddenly as they had
      appeared, the Warblers disappeared. That is to say, most of them
      disappeared. You see they had only stopped for a visit, being on their way
      farther north.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his interest in the affairs of others of his feathered friends, Peter
      had quite forgotten the Warblers. Then one day when he was in the Green
      Forest where the spruce-trees grow, he stopped to rest. This particular
      part of the Green Forest was low and damp, and on many of the trees gray
      moss grew, hanging down from the branches and making the trees look much
      older than they really were. Peter was staring at a hanging branch of this
      moss without thinking anything about it when suddenly a little bird
      alighted on it and disappeared in it. At least, that is what Peter
      thought. But it was all so unexpected that he couldn't be sure his eyes
      hadn't fooled him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, right away he became very much interested in that bunch of
      moss. He stared at it very hard. At first it looked no different from a
      dozen other bunches of moss, but presently he noticed that it was a little
      thicker than other bunches, as if somehow it had been woven together. He
      hopped off to one side so he could see better. It looked as if in one side
      of that bunch of moss was a little round hole. Peter blinked and looked
      very hard indeed to make sure. A minute later there was no doubt at all,
      for a little feathered head was poked out and a second later a dainty mite
      of a bird flew out and alighted very close to Peter. It was one of the
      smaller members of the Warbler family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sprite!&rdquo; cried Peter joyously. &ldquo;I missed you when your cousins passed
      through here, and I thought you had gone to the Far North with the rest of
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I haven't, and what's more I'm not going to go on to the Far North.
      I'm going to stay right here,&rdquo; declared Sprite the Parula Warbler, for
      that is who it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Peter looked at Sprite he couldn't help thinking that there wasn't a
      daintier member in the whole Warbler family. His coat was of a soft bluish
      color with a yellowish patch in the very center of his back. Across each
      wing were two bars of white. His throat was yellow. Just beneath it was a
      little band of bluish-black. His breast was yellow and his sides were
      grayish and brownish-chestnut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sprite, you're just beautiful,&rdquo; declared Peter in frank admiration. &ldquo;What
      was the reason I didn't see you up in the Old Orchard with your cousins?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I wasn't there,&rdquo; was Sprite's prompt reply as he flitted about,
      quite unable to sit still a minute. &ldquo;I wasn't there because I like the
      Green Forest better, so I came straight here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were you doing just now in that bunch of moss?&rdquo; demanded Peter, a
      sudden suspicion of the truth hopping into his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just looking it over,&rdquo; replied Sprite, trying to look innocent.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that very instant Peter looked up just in time to see a tail
      disappearing in the little round hole in the side of the bunch of moss. He
      knew that that tail belonged to Mrs. Sprite, and just that glimpse told
      him all he wanted to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got a nest in there!&rdquo; Peter exclaimed excitedly. &ldquo;There's no use
      denying it, Sprite; you've got a nest in there! What a perfectly lovely
      place for a nest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sprite saw at once that it would be quite useless to try to deceive Peter.
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Mrs. Sprite and I have a nest in there. We've just
      finished it. I think myself it is rather nice. We always build in moss
      like this. All we have to do is to find a nice thick bunch and then weave
      it together at the bottom and line the inside with fine grasses. It looks
      so much like all the rest of the bunches of moss that it is seldom any one
      finds it. I wouldn't trade nests with anybody I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't it rather lonesome over here by yourselves?&rdquo; asked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; replied Sprite. &ldquo;You see, we are not as much alone as you
      think. My cousin, Fidget the Myrtle Warbler, is nesting not very far away,
      and another cousin Weechi the Magnolia Warbler is also quite near. Both
      have begun housekeeping already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course Peter was all excitement and interest at once. &ldquo;Where are their
      homes?&rdquo; he asked eagerly. &ldquo;Tell me where they are and I'll go straight
      over and call.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; said Sprite severely, &ldquo;you ought to know better than to ask me to
      tell you anything of this kind. You have been around enough to know that
      there is no secret so precious as the secret of a home. You happened to
      find mine, and I guess I can trust you not to tell anybody where it is. If
      you can find the homes of Fidget and Weechi, all right, but I certainly
      don't intend to tell you where they are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter knew that Sprite was quite right in refusing to tell the secrets of
      his cousins, but he couldn't think of going home without at least looking
      for those homes. He tried to look very innocent as he asked if they also
      were in hanging bunches of moss. But Sprite was too smart to be fooled and
      Peter learned nothing at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time Peter hopped around this way and that way, thinking every
      bunch of moss he saw must surely contain a nest. But though he looked and
      looked and looked, not another little round hole did he find, and there
      were so many bunches of moss that finally his neck ached from tipping his
      head back so much. Now Peter hasn't much patience as he might have, so
      after a while he gave up the search and started on his way home. On higher
      ground, just above the low swampy place where grew the moss-covered trees,
      he came to a lot of young hemlock-trees. These had no moss on them. Having
      given up his search Peter was thinking of other things when there flitted
      across in front of him a black and gray bird with a yellow cap, yellow
      sides, and a yellow patch at the root of his tail. Those yellow patches
      were all Peter needed to see to recognize Fidget the Myrtle Warbler, one
      of the two friends he had been so long looking for down among the
      moss-covered trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Fidget!&rdquo; cried Peter, hurrying after the restless little bird. &ldquo;Oh,
      Fidget! I've been looking everywhere for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here I am,&rdquo; retorted Fidget. &ldquo;You didn't look everywhere or you
      would have found me before. What can I do for you?&rdquo; All the time Fidget
      was hopping and flitting about, never still an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can tell me where your nest is,&rdquo; replied Peter promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can, but I won't,&rdquo; retorted Fidget. &ldquo;Now honestly, Peter, do you think
      you have any business to ask such a question?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter hung his head and then replied quite honestly, &ldquo;No I don't, Fidget.
      But you see Sprite told me that you had a nest not very far from his and
      I've looked at bunches of moss until I've got a crick in the back of my
      neck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bunches of moss!&rdquo; exclaimed Fidget. &ldquo;What under the sun do you think I
      have to do with bunches of moss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why&mdash;I just thought you probably had your nest in one, the
      same as your cousin Sprite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fidget laughed right out. &ldquo;I'm afraid you would have a worse crick in the
      back of your neck than you've got now before ever you found my nest in a
      bunch of moss,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Moss may suit my cousin Sprite, but it doesn't
      suit me at all. Besides, I don't like those dark places where the moss
      grows on the trees. I build my nest of twigs and grass and weed-stalks and
      I line it with hair and rootlets and feathers. Sometimes I bind it
      together with spider silk, and if you really want to know, I like a little
      hemlock-tree to put it in. It isn't very far from here, but where it is
      I'm not going to tell you. Have you seen my cousin, Weechi?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Peter. &ldquo;Is he anywhere around here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right here,&rdquo; replied another voice and Weechi the Magnolia Warbler
      dropped down on the ground for just a second right in front of Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The top of his head and the back of his neck were gray. Above his eye was
      a white stripe and his cheeks were black. His throat was clear yellow,
      just below which was a black band. From this black streaks ran down across
      his yellow breast. At the root of his tail he was yellow. His tail was
      mostly black on top and white underneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wings were black and gray with two white bars. He was a little smaller
      than Fidget the Myrtle Warbler and quite as restless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter fairly itched to ask Weechi where his nest was, but by this time he
      had learned a lesson, so wisely kept his tongue still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were you fellows talking about?&rdquo; asked Weechi.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nests,&rdquo; replied Fidget. &ldquo;I've just been telling Peter that while Cousin
      Sprite may like to build in that hanging moss down there, it wouldn't suit
      me at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor me either,&rdquo; declared Weechi promptly. &ldquo;I prefer to build a real nest
      just as you do. By the way, Fidget, I stopped to look at your nest this
      morning. I find we build a good deal alike and we like the same sort of a
      place to put it. I suppose you know that I am a rather near neighbor of
      yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I know it,&rdquo; replied Fidget. &ldquo;In fact I watched you start your
      nest. Don't you think you have it rather near the ground?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not too near, Fidget; not too near. I am not as high-minded as some
      people. I like to be within two or three feet of the ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do myself,&rdquo; replied Fidget.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fidget and Weechi became so interested in discussing nests and the proper
      way of building them they quite forgot Peter Rabbit. Peter sat around for
      a while listening, but being more interested in seeing those nests than
      hearing about them, he finally stole away to look for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked and looked, but there were so many young hemlock-trees and they
      looked so much alike that finally Peter lost patience and gave it up as a
      bad job.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII. A New Friend and an Old One.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Peter Rabbit never will forget the first time he caught a glimpse of Glory
      the Cardinal, sometimes called Redbird. He had come up to the Old Orchard
      for his usual morning visit and just as he hopped over the old stone wall
      he heard a beautiful clear, loud whistle which drew his eyes to the top of
      an apple-tree. Peter stopped short with a little gasp of sheer
      astonishment and delight. Then he rubbed his eyes and looked again. He
      couldn't quite believe that he saw what he thought he saw. He hadn't
      supposed that any one, even among the feathered folks, could be quite so
      beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger was dressed all in red, excepting a little black around the
      base of his bill. Even his bill was red. He wore a beautiful red crest
      which made him still more distinguished looking, and how he could sing!
      Peter had noticed that quite often the most beautifully dressed birds have
      the poorest songs. But this stranger's song was as beautiful as his coat,
      and that was one of the most beautiful, if not the most beautiful, that
      Peter ever had seen. Of course he lost no time in hunting up Jenny Wren.
      &ldquo;Who is it, Jenny? Who is that beautiful stranger with such a lovely
      song?&rdquo; cried Peter, as soon as he caught sight of Jenny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Glory the Cardinal,&rdquo; replied Jenny Wren promptly. &ldquo;Isn't he the
      loveliest thing you've ever seen? I do hope he is going to stay here. As I
      said before, I don't often envy any one's fine clothes, but when I see
      Glory I'm sometimes tempted to be envious. If I were Mrs. Cardinal I'm
      afraid I should be jealous. There she is in the very same tree with him.
      Did you ever see such a difference?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter looked eagerly. Instead of the glorious red of Glory, Mrs. Cardinal
      wore a very dull dress. Her back was a brownish-gray. Her throat was a
      grayish-black. Her breast was a dull buff with a faint tinge of red. Her
      wings and tail were tinged with dull red. Altogether she was very soberly
      dressed, but a trim, neat looking little person. But if she wasn't
      handsomely dressed she could sing. In fact she was almost as good a singer
      as her handsome husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've noticed,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;that people with fine clothes spend most of
      their time thinking about them and are of very little use when it comes to
      real work in life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you needn't think that of Glory,&rdquo; declared Jenny in her vigorous
      way. &ldquo;He's just as fine as he is handsome. He's a model husband. If they
      make their home around here you'll find him doing his full share in the
      care of their babies. Sometimes they raise two families. When they do
      that, Glory takes charge of the first lot of youngsters as soon as they
      are able to leave the nest so that Mrs. Cardinal has nothing to worry
      about while she is sitting on the second lot of eggs. He fusses over them
      as if they were the only children in the world. Everybody loves Glory.
      Excuse me, Peter, I'm going over to find out if they are really going to
      stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Jenny returned she was so excited she couldn't keep still a minute.
      &ldquo;They like here, Peter!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;They like here so much that if they
      can find a place to suit them for a nest they're going to stay. I told
      them that it is the very best place in the world. They like an evergreen
      tree to build in, and I think they've got their eyes on those evergreens
      up near Farmer Brown's house. My, they will add a lot to the quality of
      this neighborhood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. Cardinal whistled and sang as if their hearts were bursting
      with joy, and Peter sat around listening as if he had nothing else in the
      world to do. Probably he would have sat there the rest of the morning had
      he not caught sight of an old friend of whom he is very fond, Kitty the
      Catbird. In contrast with Glory, Kitty seemed a regular little Quaker, for
      he was dressed almost wholly in gray, a rather dark, slaty-gray. The top
      of his head and tail were black, and right at the base of his tail was a
      patch of chestnut color. He was a little smaller than Welcome Robin. There
      was no danger of mistaking him for anybody else, for there is no one
      dressed at all like him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter forgot all about Glory in his pleasure at discovering the returned
      Kitty and hurried over to welcome him. Kitty had disappeared among the
      bushes along the old stone wall, but Peter had no trouble in finding him
      by the queer cries he was uttering, which were very like the meow of Black
      Pussy the Cat. They were very harsh and unpleasant and Peter understood
      perfectly why their maker is called the Catbird. He did not hurry in among
      the bushes at once but waited expectantly. In a few minutes the harsh
      cries ceased and then there came from the very same place a song which
      seemed to be made up of parts of the songs of all the other birds of the
      Old Orchard. It was not loud, but it was charming. It contained the clear
      whistle of Glory, and there was even the tinkle of Little Friend the Song
      Sparrow. The notes of other friends were in that song, and with them were
      notes of southern birds whose songs Kitty had learned while spending the
      winter in the South. Then there were notes all his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter listened until the song ended, then scampered in among the bushes.
      At once those harsh cries broke out again. You would have thought that
      Kitty was scolding Peter for coming to see him instead of being glad. But
      that was just Kitty's way. He is simply brimming over with fun and
      mischief, and delights to pretend.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Peter found him, he was sitting with all his feathers puffed out
      until he looked almost like a ball with a head and tail. He looked
      positively sleepy. Then as he caught sight of Peter he drew those feathers
      down tight, cocked his tail up after the manner of Jenny Wren, and was as
      slim and trim looking as any bird of Peter's acquaintance. He didn't look
      at all like the same bird of the moment before. Then he dropped his tail
      as if he hadn't strength enough to hold it up at all. It hung straight
      down. He dropped his wings and all in a second made himself look fairly
      disreputable. But all the time his eyes were twinkling and snapping, and
      Peter knew that these changes in appearance were made out of pure fun and
      mischief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been wondering if you were coming hack,&rdquo; cried Peter. &ldquo;I don't know
      of any one of my feathered friends I would miss so much as you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; responded Kitty. &ldquo;It's very nice of you to say that, Peter.
      If you are glad to see me I am still more glad to get back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you pass a pleasant winter down South?&rdquo; asked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fairly so. Fairly so,&rdquo; replied Kitty. &ldquo;By the way, Peter, I picked up
      some new songs down there. Would you like to hear them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; replied Peter, &ldquo;but I don't think you need any new songs.
      I've never seen such a fellow for picking up other people's songs
      excepting Mocker the Mockingbird.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the mention of Mocker a little cloud crossed Kitty's face for just an
      instant. &ldquo;There's a fellow I really envy,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I'm pretty good at
      imitating others, but Mocker is better. I'm hoping that, if I practice
      enough, some day I can be as good. I saw a lot of him in the South and he
      certainly is clever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh! You don't need to envy him,&rdquo; retorted Peter. &ldquo;You are some imitator
      yourself. How about those new notes you got when you were in the South?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty's face cleared, his throat swelled and he began to sing. It was a
      regular medley. It didn't seem as if so many notes could come from one
      throat. When it ended Peter had a question all ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to build somewhere near here?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly am,&rdquo; replied Kitty. &ldquo;Mrs. Catbird was delayed a day or two. I
      hope she'll get here to-day and then we'll get busy at once. I think we
      shall build in these bushes here somewhere. I'm glad Farmer Brown has
      sense enough to let them grow. They are just the kind of a place I like
      for a nest. They are near enough to Farmer Brown's garden, and the Old
      Orchard is right here. That's just the kind of a combination that suits
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter looked somewhat uncertain. &ldquo;Why do you want to be near Farmer
      Brown's garden?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because that is where I will get a good part of my living,&rdquo; Kitty
      responded promptly. &ldquo;He ought to be glad to have me about. Once in a while
      I take a little fruit, but I pay for it ten times over by the number of
      bugs and worms I get in his garden and the Old Orchard. I pride myself on
      being useful. There's nothing like being useful in this world, Peter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter nodded as if he quite agreed. Though, as you know and I know, Peter
      himself does very little except fill his own big stomach.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII. Peter Sees Rosebreast and Finds Redcoat.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's that?&rdquo; Peter Rabbit pricked up his long ears and stared up at the
      tops of the trees of the Old Orchard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly Jenny Wren popped her head out of her doorway. She cocked her
      head on one side to listen, then looked down at Peter, and her sharp
      little eyes snapped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't hear any strange voice,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;The way you are staring,
      Peter Rabbit, one would think that you had really heard something new and
      worth while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then there were two or three rather sharp, squeaky notes from the top
      of one of the trees. &ldquo;There!&rdquo; cried Peter. &ldquo;There! Didn't you hear that,
      Jenny Wren?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For goodness' sake, Peter Rabbit, you don't mean to say you don't know
      whose voice that is,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;That's Rosebreast. He and Mrs.
      Rosebreast have been here for quite a little while. I didn't suppose there
      was any one who didn't know those sharp, squeaky voices. They rather get
      on my nerves. What anybody wants to squeak like that for when they can
      sing as Rosebreast can, is more than I can understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that very instant Mr. Wren began to scold as only he and Jenny can.
      Peter looked up at Jenny and winked slyly. &ldquo;And what anybody wants to
      scold like that for when they can sing as Mr. Wren can, is too much for
      me,&rdquo; retorted Peter. &ldquo;But you haven't told me who Rosebreast is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Grosbeak, of course, stupid,&rdquo; sputtered Jenny. &ldquo;If you don't know
      Rosebreast the Grosbeak, Peter Rabbit, you certainly must have been blind
      and deaf ever since you were born. Listen to that! Just listen to that
      song!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter listened. There were many songs, for it was a very beautiful morning
      and all the singers of the Old Orchard were pouring out the joy that was
      within them. One song was a little louder and clearer than the others
      because it came from a tree very close at hand, the very tree from which
      those squeaky notes had come just a few minutes before. Peter suspected
      that that must be the song Jenny Wren meant. He looked puzzled. He was
      puzzled. &ldquo;Do you mean Welcome Robin's song?&rdquo; he asked rather sheepishly,
      for he had a feeling that he would be the victim of Jenny Wren's sharp
      tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't mean Welcome Robin's song,&rdquo; snapped Jenny. &ldquo;What good are a
      pair of long ears if they can't tell one song from another? That song may
      sound something like Welcome Robin's, but if your ears were good for
      anything at all you'd know right away that that isn't Welcome Robin
      singing. That's a better song than Welcome Robin's. Welcome Robin's song
      is one of good cheer, but this one is of pure happiness. I wouldn't have a
      pair of ears like yours for anything in the world, Peter Rabbit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter laughed right out as he tried to picture to himself Jenny Wren with
      a pair of long ears like his. &ldquo;What are you laughing at?&rdquo; demanded Jenny
      crossly. &ldquo;Don't you dare laugh at me! If there is any one thing I can't
      stand it is being laughed at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn't laughing at you,&rdquo; replied Peter very meekly. &ldquo;I was just
      laughing, at the thought of how funny you would look with a pair of long
      ears like mine. Now you speak of it, Jenny, that song IS quite different
      from Welcome Robin's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is,&rdquo; retorted Jenny. &ldquo;That is Rosebreast singing up there,
      and there he is right in the top of that tree. Isn't he handsome?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter looked up to see a bird a little smaller than Welcome Robin. His
      head, throat and back were black. His wings were black with patches of
      white on them. But it was his breast that made Peter catch his breath with
      a little gasp of admiration, for that breast was a beautiful rose-red. The
      rest of him underneath was white. It was Rosebreast the Grosbeak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't he lovely!&rdquo;' cried Peter, and added in the next breath, &ldquo;Who is
      that with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Grosbeak, of course. Who else would it be?&rdquo; sputtered Jenny rather
      crossly, for she was still a little put out because she had been laughed
      at.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would never have guessed it,&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;She doesn't look the least
      bit like him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was quite true. There was no beautiful rose color about Mrs.
      Grosbeak. She was dressed chiefly in brown and grayish colors with a
      little buff here and there and with dark streaks on her breast. Over each
      eye was a whitish line. Altogether she looked more as if she might be a
      big member of the Sparrow family than the wife of handsome Rosebreast.
      While Rosebreast sang, Mrs. Grosbeak was very busily picking buds and
      blossoms from the tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is she doing that for?&rdquo; inquired Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the same reason that you bite off sweet clover blossoms and leaves,&rdquo;
       replied Jenny Wren tartly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say that they live on buds and blossoms?&rdquo; cried Peter. &ldquo;I
      never heard of such a thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, tut, tut, tut, tut! You can ask more silly questions than anybody of
      my acquaintance,&rdquo; retorted Jenny Wren. &ldquo;Of course they don't live on buds
      and blossoms. If they did they would soon starve to death, for buds and
      blossoms don't last long. They eat a few just for variety, but they live
      mostly on bugs and insects. You ask Farmer Brown's boy who helps him most
      in his potato patch, and he'll tell you it's the Grosbeaks. They certainly
      do love potato bugs. They eat some fruit, but on the whole they are about
      as useful around a garden as any one I know. Now run along, Peter Rabbit,
      and don't bother me any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seeing Farmer Brown's boy coming through the Old Orchard Peter decided
      that it was high time for him to depart. So he scampered for the Green
      Forest, lipperty-lipperty-lip. Just within the edge of the Green Forest he
      caught sight of something which for the time being put all thought of
      Farmer Brown's boy out of his head. Fluttering on the ground was a bird
      than whom not even Glory the Cardinal was more beautiful. It was about the
      size of Redwing the Blackbird. Wings and tail were pure black and all the
      rest was a beautiful scarlet. It was Redcoat the Tanager. At first Peter
      had eyes only for the wonderful beauty of Redcoat. Never before had he
      seen Redcoat so close at hand. Then quite suddenly it came over Peter that
      something was wrong with Redcoat, and he hurried forward to see what the
      trouble might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Redcoat heard the rustle of Peter's feet among the dry leaves and at once
      began to flap and flutter in an effort to fly away, but he could not get
      off the ground. &ldquo;What is it, Redcoat? Has something happened to you? It is
      just Peter Rabbit. You don't have anything to fear from me,&rdquo; cried Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The look of terror which had been in the eyes of Redcoat died out, and he
      stopped fluttering and simply lay panting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Peter,&rdquo; he gasped, &ldquo;you don't know how glad I am that it is only you.
      I've had a terrible accident, and I don't know what I am to do. I can't
      fly, and if I have to stay on the ground some enemy will be sure to get
      me. What shall I do, Peter? What shall I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Right away Peter was full of sympathy. &ldquo;What kind of an accident was it,
      Redcoat, and how did it happen?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Broadwing the Hawk tried to catch me,&rdquo; sobbed Redcoat. &ldquo;In dodging him
      among the trees I was heedless for a moment and did not see just where I
      was going. I struck a sharp-pointed dead twig and drove it right through
      my right wing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Redcoat held up his right wing and sure enough there was a little stick
      projecting from both sides close up to the shoulder. The wing was bleeding
      a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear, whatever shall I do, Peter Rabbit? Whatever shall I do?&rdquo; sobbed
      Redcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it pain you dreadfully?&rdquo; asked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Redcoat nodded. &ldquo;But I don't mind the pain,&rdquo; he hastened to say. &ldquo;It is
      the thought of what MAY happen to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Mrs. Tanager was flying about in the tree tops near at hand and
      calling anxiously. She was dressed almost wholly in light olive-green and
      greenish-yellow. She looked no more like beautiful Redcoat than did Mrs.
      Grosbeak like Rosebreast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you fly up just a little way so as to get off the ground?&rdquo; she
      cried anxiously. &ldquo;Isn't it dreadful, Peter Rabbit, to have such an
      accident? We've just got our nest half built, and I don't know what I
      shall do if anything happens to Redcoat. Oh, dear, here comes somebody!
      Hide, Redcoat! Hide!&rdquo; Mrs. Tanager flew off a short distance to one side
      and began to cry as if in the greatest distress. Peter knew instantly that
      she was crying to get the attention of whoever was coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Redcoat, with the old look of terror in his eyes, fluttered along,
      trying to find something under which to hide. But there was nothing under
      which he could crawl, and there was no hiding that wonderful red coat.
      Peter heard the sound of heavy footsteps, and looking back, saw that
      Farmer Brown's boy was coming. &ldquo;Don't be afraid, Redcoat,&rdquo; he whispered.
      &ldquo;It's Farmer Brown's boy and I'm sure he won't hurt you. Perhaps he can
      help you.&rdquo; Then Peter scampered off for a short distance and sat up to
      watch what would happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of coarse Farmer Brown's boy saw Redcoat. No one with any eyes at all
      could have helped seeing him, because of that wonderful scarlet coat. He
      saw, too, by the way Redcoat was acting, that he was in great trouble. As
      Farmer Brown's boy drew near and Redcoat saw that he was discovered, he
      tried his hardest to flutter away. Farmer Brown's boy understood instantly
      that something was wrong with one wing, and running forward, he caught
      Redcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You poor little thing. You poor, beautiful little creature,&rdquo; said Farmer
      Brown's boy softly as he saw the cruel twig sticking through Redcoats'
      shoulder. &ldquo;We'll have to get that out right away,&rdquo; continued Farmer
      Brown's boy, stroking Redcoat ever so gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow at that gentle touch Redcoat lost much of his fear, and a little
      hope sprang in his heart. He saw, too, this was no enemy, but a friend.
      Farmer Brown's boy took out his knife and carefully cut off the twig on
      the upper side of the wing. Then, doing his best to be careful and to hurt
      as little as possible, he worked the other part of the twig out from the
      under side. Carefully he examined the wing to see if any bones were
      broken. None were, and after holding Redcoat a few minutes he carefully
      set him up in a tree and withdrew a short distance. Redcoat hopped from
      branch to branch until he was halfway up the tree. Then he sat there for
      some time as if fearful of trying that injured wing. Meanwhile Mrs.
      Tanager came and fussed about him and talked to him and coaxed him and
      made as much of him as if he were a baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter remained right where he was until at last he saw Redcoat spread his
      black wings and fly to another tree. From tree to tree he flew, resting a
      bit in each until he and Mrs. Tanager disappeared in the Green Forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew Farmer Brown's boy would help him, and I'm so glad he found him,&rdquo;
       cried Peter happily and started for the dear Old Briar-patch.

      CHAPTER XXIX. The Constant Singers.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Over in a maple-tree on the edge of Farmer Brown's door yard lived Mr. and
      Mrs. Redeye the Vireos. Peter Rabbit knew that they had a nest there
      because Jenny Wren had told him so. He would have guessed it anyway,
      because Redeye spent so much time in that tree during the nesting season.
      No matter what hour of the day Peter visited the Old Orchard he heard
      Redeye singing over in the maple-tree. Peter used to think that if song is
      an expression of happiness, Redeye must be the happiest of all birds.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a little fellow about the size of one of the larger Warblers and
      quite as modestly dressed as any of Peter's acquaintances. The crown of
      his head was gray with a little blackish border on either side. Over each
      eye was a white line. Underneath he was white. For the rest he was dressed
      in light olive-green. The first time he came down near enough for Peter to
      see him well Peter understood at once why he is called Redeye. His eyes
      were red. Yes, sir, his eyes were red and this fact alone was enough to
      distinguish him from any other members of his family.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it wasn't often that Redeye came down so near the ground that Peter
      could see his eyes. He preferred to spend most of his time in the tree
      tops, and Peter only got glimpses of him now and then. But if he didn't
      see him often it was less often that he failed to hear him. &ldquo;I don't see
      when Redeye finds time to eat,&rdquo; declared Peter as he listened to the
      seemingly unending song in the maple-tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Redeye believes in singing while he works,&rdquo; said Jenny Wren. &ldquo;For my part
      I should think he'd wear his throat out. When other birds sing they don't
      do anything else, but Redeye sings all the time he is hunting his meals
      and only stops long enough to swallow a worm or a bug when he finds it.
      Just as soon as it is down he begins to sing again while he hunts for
      another. I must say for the Redeyes that they are mighty good nest
      builders. Have you seen their nest over in that maple-tree, Peter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't dare go over there except very early in the morning before Farmer
      Brown's folks are awake,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;so I haven't had much chance to look
      for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You probably couldn't see it, anyway,&rdquo; declared Jenny Wren. &ldquo;They have
      placed it rather high up from the ground and those leaves are so thick
      that they hide it. It's a regular little basket fastened in a fork near
      the end of a branch and it is woven almost as nicely as is the nest of
      Goldy the Oriole. How anybody has the patience to weave a nest like that
      is beyond me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's it made of?&rdquo; asked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strips of bark, plant down, spider's web, grass, and pieces of paper!&rdquo;
       replied Jenny. &ldquo;That's a funny thing about Redeye; he dearly loves a piece
      of paper in his nest. What for, I can't imagine. He's as fussy about
      having a scrap of paper as Cresty the Flycatcher is about having a piece
      of Snakeskin. I had just a peep into that nest a few days ago and unless I
      am greatly mistaken Sally Sly the Cowbird has managed to impose on the
      Redeyes. I am certain I saw one of her eggs in that nest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few mornings after this talk with Jenny Wren about Redeye the Vireo
      Peter once more visited the Old Orchard. No sooner did he come in sight
      than Jenny Wren's tongue began to fly. &ldquo;What did I tell you, Peter Rabbit?
      What did I tell you? I knew it was so, and it is!&rdquo; cried Jenny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is so?&rdquo; asked Peter rather testily, for he hadn't the least idea
      what Jenny Wren was talking about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sally Sly DID lay an egg in Redeye's nest, and now it has hatched and I
      don't know whatever is to become of Redeye's own children. It's perfectly
      scandalous! That's what it is, perfectly scandalous!&rdquo; cried Jenny, and
      hopped about and jerked her tail and worked herself into a small brown
      fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Redeyes are working themselves to feathers and bone feeding that ugly
      young Cowbird while their own babies aren't getting half enough to eat,&rdquo;
       continued Jenny. &ldquo;One of them has died already. He was kicked out of the
      nest by that young brute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dreadful!&rdquo; cried Peter. &ldquo;If he does things like that I should think
      the Redeyes would throw HIM out of the nest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're too soft-hearted,&rdquo; declared Jenny. &ldquo;I can tell you I wouldn't be
      so soft-hearted if I were in their place. No, sir-ee, I wouldn't! But they
      say it isn't his fault that he's there, and that he's nothing but a
      helpless baby, and so they just take care of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why don't they feed their own babies first and give him what's
      left?&rdquo; demanded Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he's twice as big as any of their own babies and so strong and
      greedy that he simply snatches the food out of the very mouths of the
      others. Because he gets most of the food, he's growing twice as fast as
      they are. I wouldn't be surprised if he kicks all the rest of them out
      before he gets through. Mr. and Mrs. Redeye are dreadfully distressed
      about it, but they will feed him because they say it isn't his fault. It's
      a dreadful affair and the talk of the whole Orchard. I suppose his mother
      is off gadding somewhere, having a good time and not caring a flip of her
      tail feathers what becomes of him. I believe in being goodhearted, but
      there is such a thing as overdoing the matter. Thank goodness I'm not so
      weak-minded that I can be imposed on in any such way as that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speaking of the Vireos, Redeye seems to be the only member of his family
      around here,&rdquo; remarked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; commanded Jenny Wren. &ldquo;Don't you hear that warbling song 'way
      over in the big elm in front of Farmer Brown's house where Goldy the
      oriole has his nest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter listened. At first he didn't hear it, and as usual Jenny Wren made
      fun of him for having such big ears and not being able to make better use
      of them. Presently he did hear it. The voice was not unlike that of
      Redeye, but the song was smoother, more continuous and sweeter. Peter's
      face lighted up. &ldquo;I hear it,&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's Redeye's cousin, the Warbling Vireo,&rdquo; said Jenny. &ldquo;He's a better
      singer than Redeye and just as fond of hearing his own voice. He sings
      from the time jolly Mr. Sun gets up in the morning until he goes to bed at
      night. He sings when it is so hot that the rest of us are glad to keep
      still for comfort's sake. I don't know of anybody more fond of the tree
      tops than he is. He doesn't seem to care anything about the Old Orchard,
      but stays over in those big trees along the road. He's got a nest over in
      that big elm and it is as high up as that of Goldy the Oriole; I haven't
      seen it myself, but Goldy told me about it. Why any one so small should
      want to live so high up in the world I don't know, any more than I know
      why any one wants to live anywhere but in the Old Orchard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somehow I don't remember just what Warble looks like,&rdquo; Peter confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looks a lot like his cousin, Redeye,&rdquo; replied Jenny. &ldquo;His coat is a
      little duller olive-green and underneath he is a little bit yellowish
      instead of being white. Of course he doesn't have red eyes, and he is a
      little smaller than Redeye. The whole family looks pretty much alike
      anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said something then, Jenny Wren,&rdquo; declared Peter. &ldquo;They get me all
      mixed up. If only some of them had some bright colors it would be easier
      to tell them apart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One has,&rdquo; replied Jenny Wren. &ldquo;He has a bright yellow throat and breast
      and is called the Yellow-throated Vireo. There isn't the least chance of
      mistaking him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he a singer, too?&rdquo; asked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; replied Jenny. &ldquo;Every one of that blessed family loves the
      sound of his own voice. It's a family trait. Sometimes it just makes my
      throat sore to listen to them all day long. A good thing is good, but more
      than enough of a good thing is too much. That applies to gossiping just as
      well as to singing and I've wasted more time on you than I've any business
      to. Now hop along, Peter, and don't bother me any more to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter hopped.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX. Jenny Wren's Cousins.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Peter Rabbit never will forget his surprise when Jenny Wren asked him one
      spring morning if he had seen anything of her big cousin. Peter hesitated.
      As a matter of fact, he couldn't think of any big cousin of Jenny Wren.
      All the cousins he knew anything about were very nearly Jenny's own size.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Jenny Wren is one of the most impatient small persons in the world.
      &ldquo;Well, well, well, Peter, have you lost your tongue?&rdquo; she chattered.
      &ldquo;Can't you answer a simple question without talking all day about it? Have
      you seen anything of my big cousin? It is high time for him to be here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn't be so cross about it if I am slow,&rdquo; replied Peter. &ldquo;I'm just
      trying to think who your big cousin is. I guess, to be quite honest, I
      don't know him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't know him! Don't know him!&rdquo; Sputtered Jenny. &ldquo;Of course you know
      him. You can't help but know him. I mean Brownie the Thrasher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In his surprise Peter fairly jumped right off the ground. &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo;
       he exclaimed. &ldquo;Since when was Brownie the Thrasher related to the Wren
      family?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ever since there have been any Wrens and Thrashers,&rdquo; retorted Jenny.
      &ldquo;Brownie belongs to one branch of the family and I belong to another, and
      that makes him my second cousin. It certainly is surprising how little
      some folks know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have always supposed he belonged to the Thrush family,&rdquo; protested
      Peter. &ldquo;He certainly looks like a Thrush.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looking like one doesn't make him one,&rdquo; snapped Jenny. &ldquo;By this time you
      ought to leave learned that you never can judge anybody just by looks. It
      always makes me provoked to hear Brownie called the Brown Thrush. There
      isn't a drop of Thrush blood in him. But you haven't answered my question
      yet, Peter Rabbit. I want to know if he has got here yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;I saw him only yesterday on the edge of the Old
      Pasture. He was fussing around in the bushes and on the ground and jerking
      that long tail of his up and down and sidewise as if he couldn't decide
      what to do with it. I've never seen anybody twitch their tail around the
      way he does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jenny Wren giggled. &ldquo;That's just like him,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;It is because he
      thrashes his tail around so much that he is called a Thrasher. I suppose
      he was wearing his new spring suit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know whether it was a new suit or not, but it was mighty good
      looking,&rdquo; replied Peter. &ldquo;I just love that beautiful reddish-brown of his
      back, wings and tail, and it certainly does set off his white and buff
      waistcoat with those dark streaks and spots. You must admit, Jenny Wren,
      that any one seeing him dressed so much like the Thrushes is to be excused
      for thinking him a Thrush.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; admitted Jenny rather grudgingly. &ldquo;But none of the
      Thrushes have such a bright brown coat. Brownie is handsome, if I do say
      so. Did you notice what a long bill he has?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter nodded. &ldquo;And I noticed that he had two white bars on each wing,&rdquo;
       said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad you're so observing,&rdquo; replied Jenny dryly. &ldquo;Did you hear him
      sing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I hear him sing!&rdquo; cried Peter, his eyes shining at the memory. &ldquo;He
      sang especially for me. He flew up to the top of a tree, tipped his head
      back and sang as few birds I know of can sing. He has a wonderful voice,
      has Brownie. I don't know of anybody I enjoy listening to more. And when
      he's singing he acts as if he enjoyed it himself and knows what a good
      singer he is. I noticed that long tail of his hung straight down the same
      way Mr. Wren's does when he sings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it did,&rdquo; replied Jenny promptly. &ldquo;That's a family trait. The
      tails of both my other big cousins do the same thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wha-wha-what's that? Have you got more big cousins?&rdquo; cried Peter, staring
      up at Jenny as if she were some strange person he never had seen before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; retorted Jenny. &ldquo;Mocker the Mockingbird and Kitty the Catbird
      belong to Brownie's family, and that makes them second cousins to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such a funny expression as there was on Peter's face. He felt that Jenny
      Wren was telling the truth, but it was surprising news to him and so hard
      to believe that for a few minutes he couldn't find his tongue to ask
      another question. Finally he ventured to ask very timidly, &ldquo;Does Brownie
      imitate the songs of other birds the way Mocker and Kitty do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jenny Wren shook her head very decidedly. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;He's perfectly
      satisfied with his own song.&rdquo; Before she could add anything further the
      clear whistle of Glory the Cardinal sounded from a tree just a little way
      off. Instantly Peter forgot all about Jenny Wren's relatives and scampered
      over to that tree. You see Glory is so beautiful that Peter never loses a
      chance to see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Peter sat staring up into the tree, trying to get a glimpse of Glory's
      beautiful red coat, the clear, sweet whistle sounded once more. It drew
      Peter's eyes to one of the upper branches, but instead of the beautiful,
      brilliant coat of Glory the Cardinal he saw a bird about the size of
      Welcome Robin dressed in sober ashy-gray with two white bars on his wings,
      and white feathers on the outer edges of his tail. He was very trim and
      neat and his tail hung straight down after the manner of Brownie's when he
      was singing. It was a long tail, but not as long as Brownie's. Even as
      Peter blinked and stared in surprise the stranger opened his mouth and
      from it came Glory's own beautiful whistle. Then the stranger looked down
      at Peter, and his eyes twinkled with mischief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fooled you that time, didn't I, Peter?&rdquo; he chuckled. &ldquo;You thought you
      were going to see Glory the Cardinal, didn't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then without waiting for Peter to reply, this sober-looking stranger gave
      such a concert as no one else in the world could give. From that wonderful
      throat poured out song after song and note after note of Peter's familiar
      friends of the Old Orchard, and the performance wound up with a lovely
      song which was all the stranger's own. Peter didn't have to be told who
      the stranger was. It was Mocker the Mockingbird.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; gasped Peter. &ldquo;Oh, Mocker, how under the sun do you do it? I was
      sure that it was Glory whom I heard whistling. Never again will I be able
      to believe my own ears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mocker chuckled. &ldquo;You're not the only one I've fooled, Peter,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I
      flatter myself that I can fool almost anybody if I set out to. It's lots
      of fun. I may not be much to look at, but when it comes to singing there's
      no one I envy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you are very nice looking indeed,&rdquo; replied Peter politely. &ldquo;I've
      just been finding out this morning that you can't tell much about folks
      just by their looks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now you've learned that you can't always recognize folks by their
      voices, haven't you?&rdquo; chuckled Mocker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Peter. &ldquo;Hereafter I shall never be sure about any feathered
      folks unless I can both see and hear them. Won't you sing for me again,
      Mocker?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mocker did. He sang and sang, for he clearly loves to sing. When he
      finished Peter had another question ready. &ldquo;Somebody told me once that
      down in the South you are the best loved of all the birds. Is that so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's not for me to say,&rdquo; replied Mocker modestly. &ldquo;But I can tell you
      this, Peter, they do think a lot of me down there. There are many birds
      down there who are very beautifully dressed, birds who don't come up here
      at all. But not one of them is loved as I am, and it is all on account of
      my voice. I would rather have a beautiful voice than a fine coat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter nodded as if he quite agreed, which, when you think of it, is rather
      funny, for Peter has neither a fine coat nor a fine voice. A glint of
      mischief sparkled in Mocker's eyes. &ldquo;There's Mrs. Goldy the Oriole over
      there,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Watch me fool her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He began to call in exact imitation of Goldy's voice when he is anxious
      about something. At once Mrs. Goldy came hurrying over to find out what
      the trouble was. When she discovered Mocker she lost her temper and
      scolded him roundly; then she flew away a perfect picture of indignation.
      Mocker and Peter laughed, for they thought it a good joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Peter remembered what Jenny Wren had told him. &ldquo;Was Jenny Wren
      telling you the truth when she said that you are a second cousin of hers?&rdquo;
       he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mocker nodded. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we are relatives. We each belong to a
      branch of the same family.&rdquo; Then he burst into Mr. Wren's own song, after
      which he excused himself and went to look for Mrs. Mocker. For, as he
      explained, it was time for them to be thinking of a nest.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXI. Voices of the Dusk.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Jolly, round, red Mr. Sun was just going to bed behind the Purple Hills
      and the Black Shadows had begun to creep all through the Green Forest and
      out across the Green Meadows. It was the hour of the day Peter Rabbit
      loves best. He sat on the edge of the Green Forest watching for the first
      little star to twinkle high up in the sky. Peter felt at peace with all
      the Great World, for it was the hour of peace, the hour of rest for those
      who had been busy all through the shining day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of Peter's feathered friends had settled themselves for the coming
      night, the worries and cares of the day over and forgotten. All the Great
      World seemed hushed. In the distance Sweetvoice the Vesper Sparrow was
      pouring out his evening song, for it was the hour when he dearly loves to
      sing. Far back in the Green Forest Whip-poor-will was calling as if his
      very life depended on the number of times he could say, &ldquo;Whip poor Will,&rdquo;
       without taking a breath. From overhead came now and then the sharp, rather
      harsh cry of Boomer the Nighthawk, as he hunted his supper in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time it seemed as if these were the only feathered friends still
      awake, and Peter couldn't help thinking that those who went so early to
      bed missed the most beautiful hour of the whole day. Then, from a tree
      just back of him, there poured forth a song so clear, so sweet, so
      wonderfully suited to that peaceful hour, that Peter held his breath until
      it was finished. He knew that singer and loved him. It was Melody the Wood
      Thrush.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the song ended Peter hopped over to the tree from which it had come.
      It was still light enough for him to see the sweet singer. He sat on a
      branch near the top, his head thrown back and his soft, full throat
      throbbing with the flute-like notes he was pouring forth. He was a little
      smaller than Welcome Robin. His coat was a beautiful reddish-brown, not
      quite so bright as that of Brownie the Thrasher. Beneath he was white with
      large, black spots thickly dotting his breast and sides. He was singing as
      if he were trying to put into those beautiful notes all the joy of life.
      Listening to it Peter felt steal over him a wonderful feeling of peace and
      pure happiness. Not for the world would he have interrupted it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Black Shadows crept far across the Green Meadows and it became so
      dusky in the Green Forest that Peter could barely make out the sweet
      singer above his head. Still Melody sang on and the hush of eventide grew
      deeper, as if all the Great World were holding its breath to listen. It
      was not until several little stars had begun to twinkle high up in the sky
      that Melody stopped singing and sought the safety of his hidden perch for
      the night. Peter felt sure that somewhere near was a nest and that one
      thing which had made that song so beautiful was the love Melody lad been
      trying to express to the little mate sitting on the eggs that nest must
      contain. &ldquo;I'll just run over here early in the morning,&rdquo; thought Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Peter is a great hand to stay out all night, and that is just what he
      did that night. Just before it was time for jolly, round, red Mr. Sun to
      kick off his rosy blankets and begin his daily climb up in the blue, blue
      sky, Peter started for home in the dear Old Briar-patch. Everywhere in the
      Green Forest, in the Old Orchard, on the Green Meadows, his feathered
      friends were awakening. He had quite forgotten his intention to visit
      Melody and was reminded of it only when again he heard those beautiful
      flute-like notes. At once he scampered over to where he had spent such a
      peaceful hour the evening before. Melody saw him at once and dropped down
      on the ground for a little gossip while he scratched among the leaves in
      search of his breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just love to hear you sing, Melody,&rdquo; cried Peter rather breathlessly.
      &ldquo;I don't know of any other song that makes me feel quite as yours does, so
      sort of perfectly contented and free of care and worry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; replied Melody. &ldquo;I'm glad you like to hear me sing for there
      is nothing I like to do better. It is the one way in which I can express
      my feelings. I love all the Great World and I just have to tell it so. I
      do not mean to boast when I say that all the Thrush family have good
      voices.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have the best of all,&rdquo; cried Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Melody shook his brown head. &ldquo;I wouldn't say that,&rdquo; said he modestly. &ldquo;I
      think the song of my cousin Hermit, is even more beautiful than mine. And
      then there is my other cousin, Veery. His song is wonderful, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But just then Peter's curiosity was greater than his interest in songs.
      &ldquo;Have you built your nest yet?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Melody nodded. &ldquo;It is in a little tree not far from here,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and
      Mrs. Wood Thrush is sitting on five eggs this blessed minute. Isn't that
      perfectly lovely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Peter's turn to nod. &ldquo;What is your nest built of?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rootlets and tiny twigs and weed stalks and leaves and mud,&rdquo; replied
      Melody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mud!&rdquo; exclaimed Peter. &ldquo;Why, that's what Welcome Robin uses in his nest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Welcome Robin is my own cousin, so I don't know as there's anything
      so surprising in that,&rdquo; retorted Melody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;I had forgotten that he is a member of the Thrush
      family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he is, even if he is dressed quite differently from the rest of
      us,&rdquo; replied Melody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mentioned your cousin, Hermit. I don't believe I know him,&rdquo; said
      Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it's high time you got acquainted with him,&rdquo; replied Melody
      promptly. &ldquo;He is rather fond of being by himself and that is why he is
      called the Hermit Thrush. He is smaller than I and his coat is not such a
      bright brown. His tail is brighter than his coat. He has a waistcoat
      spotted very much like mine. Some folks consider him the most beautiful
      singer of the Thrush family. I'm glad you like my song, but you must hear
      Hermit sing. I really think there is no song so beautiful in all the Green
      Forest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he build a nest like yours?&rdquo; asked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Melody. &ldquo;He builds his nest on the ground, and he doesn't
      use any mud. Now if you'll excuse me, Peter, I must get my breakfast and
      give Mrs. Wood Thrush a chance to get hers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Peter continued on his way to the dear Old Briar-patch and there he
      spent the day. As evening approached he decided to go back to hear Melody
      sing again. Just as he drew near the Green Forest he heard from the
      direction of the Laughing Brook a song that caused him to change his mind
      and sent him hurrying in that direction. It was a very different song from
      that of Melody the Wood Thrush, yet, if he had never heard it before,
      Peter would have known that such a song could come from no throat except
      that of a member of the Thrush family. As he drew near the Laughing Brook
      the beautiful notes seemed to ring through the Green Forest like a bell.
      As Melody's song had filled Peter with a feeling of peace, so this song
      stirred in him a feeling of the wonderful mystery of life. There was in it
      the very spirit of the Green Forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      It didn't take Peter long to find the singer. It was Veery, who has been
      named Wilson's Thrush; and by some folks is known as the Tawny Thrush.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of the patter of Peter's feet the song stopped abruptly and
      he was greeted with a whistled &ldquo;Wheeu! wheeu!&rdquo; Then, seeing that it was no
      one of whom he need be afraid, Veery came out from under some ferns to
      greet Peter. He was smaller than Melody the Wood Thrush, being about
      one-fourth smaller than Welcome Robin. He wore a brown coat but it was not
      as bright as that of his cousin, Melody. His breast was somewhat faintly
      spotted with brown, and below he was white. His sides were grayish-white
      and not spotted like the sides of Melody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard you singing and I just had to come over to see you,&rdquo; cried Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you like my song,&rdquo; said Veery. &ldquo;I love to sing just at this hour
      and I love to think that other people like to hear me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do,&rdquo; declared Peter most emphatically. &ldquo;I can't imagine how anybody
      could fail to like to hear you. I came 'way over here just to sit a while
      and listen. Won't you sing some more for me, Veery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly will, Peter,&rdquo; replied Veery. &ldquo;I wouldn't feel that I was
      going to bed right if I didn't sing until dark. There is no part of the
      day I love better than the evening, and the only way I can express my
      happiness and my love of the Green Forest and the joy of just being back
      here at home is by singing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Veery slipped out of sight, and almost at once his bell-like notes began
      to ring through the Green Forest. Peter sat right where he was, content to
      just listen and feel within himself the joy of being alive and happy in
      the beautiful spring season which Veery was expressing so wonderfully. The
      Black Shadows grew blacker. One by one the little stars came out and
      twinkled down through the tree tops. Finally from deep in the Green Forest
      sounded the hunting call of Hooty the Owl. Veery's song stopped. &ldquo;Good
      night, Peter,&rdquo; he called softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, Veery,&rdquo; replied Peter and hopped back towards the Green
      Meadows for a feast of sweet clover.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXII. Peter Saves a Friend and Learns Something.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Peter Rabbit sat in a thicket of young trees on the edge of the Green
      Forest. It was warm and Peter was feeling lazy. He had nothing in
      particular to do, and as he knew of no cooler place he had squatted there
      to doze a bit and dream a bit. So far as he knew, Peter was all alone. He
      hadn't seen anybody when he entered that little thicket, and though he had
      listened he hadn't heard a sound to indicate that he didn't have that
      thicket quite to himself. It was very quiet there, and though when he
      first entered he hadn't the least intention in the world of going to
      sleep, it wasn't long before he was dozing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Peter is a light sleeper, as all little people who never know when
      they may have to run for their lives must be. By and by he awoke with a
      start, and he was very wide awake indeed. Something had wakened him,
      though just what it was he couldn't say. His long ears stood straight up
      as he listened with all his might for some little sound which might mean
      danger. His wobbly little nose wobbled very fast indeed as it tested the
      air for the scent of a possible enemy. Very alert was Peter as he waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few minutes he heard nothing and saw nothing. Then, near the outer
      edge of the thicket, he heard a great rustling of dry leaves. It must have
      been this that had wakened him. For just an instant Peter was startled,
      but only for an instant. His long ears told him at once that that noise
      was made by some one scratching among the leaves, and he knew that no one
      who did not wear feathers could scratch like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now who can that be?&rdquo; thought Peter, and stole forward very softly
      towards the place from which the sound came. Presently, as he peeped
      between the stems of the young trees, he saw the brown leaves which
      carpeted the ground fly this way and that, and in the midst of them was an
      exceedingly busy person, a little smaller than Welcome Robin, scratching
      away for dear life. Every now and then he picked up something.
    </p>
    <p>
      His head, throat, back and breast were black. Beneath he was white. His
      sides were reddish-brown. His tail was black and white, and the longer
      feathers of his wings were edged with white. It was Chewink the Towhee,
      sometimes called Ground Robin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter chuckled, but it was a noiseless chuckle. He kept perfectly still,
      for it was fun to watch some one who hadn't the least idea that he was
      being watched. It was quite clear that Chewink was hungry and that under
      those dry leaves he was finding a good meal. His feet were made for
      scratching and he certainly knew how to use them. For some time Peter sat
      there watching. He had just about made up his mind that he would make his
      presence known and have a bit of morning gossip when, happening to look
      out beyond the edge of the little thicket, he saw something red. It was
      something alive, for it was moving very slowly and cautiously towards the
      place where Chewink was so busy and forgetful of everything but his
      breakfast. Peter knew that there was only one person with a coat of that
      color. It was Reddy Fox, and quite plainly Reddy was hoping to catch
      Chewink.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a second or two Peter was quite undecided what to do. He couldn't warn
      Chewink without making his own presence known to Reddy Fox. Of course he
      could sit perfectly still and let Chewink be caught, but that was such a
      dreadful thought that Peter didn't consider it for more than a second or
      two. He suddenly thumped the ground with his feet. It was his danger
      signal which all his friends know. Then he turned and scampered
      lipperty-lipperty-lip to a thick bramble-tangle not far behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of that thump Chewink instantly flew up in a little tree.
      Then he saw Reddy Fox and began to scold. As for Reddy, he looked over
      towards the bramble-tangle and snarled. &ldquo;I'll get you one of these days,
      Peter Rabbit,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I'll get you one of these days and pay you up for
      cheating me out of a breakfast.&rdquo; Without so much as a glance at Chewink,
      Reddy turned and trotted off, trying his best to look dignified and as if
      he had never entertained such a thought as trying to catch Chewink.
    </p>
    <p>
      From his perch Chewink watched until he was sure that Reddy Fox had gone
      away for good. Then he called softly, &ldquo;Towhee! Towhee! Chewink! Chewink!
      All is safe now, Peter Rabbit. Come out and talk with me and let me tell
      you how grateful to you I am for saving my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chewink flew down to the ground and Peter crept out of the bramble-tangle.
      &ldquo;It wasn't anything,&rdquo; declared Peter. &ldquo;I saw Reddy and I knew you didn't,
      so of course I gave the alarm. You would have done the same thing for me.
      Do you know, Chewink, I've wondered a great deal about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you wondered about me?&rdquo; asked Chewink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've wondered what family you belong to,&rdquo; replied Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chewink chuckled. &ldquo;I belong to a big family,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I belong to the
      biggest family among the birds. It is the Finch and Sparrow family. There
      are a lot of us and a good many of us don't look much alike, but still we
      belong to the same family. I suppose you know that Rosebreast the Grosbeak
      and Glory the Cardinal are members of my family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't know it,&rdquo; replied Peter, &ldquo;but if you say it is so I suppose it
      must be so. It is easier to believe than it is to believe that you are
      related to the Sparrows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless I am,&rdquo; retorted Chewink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were you scratching for when I first saw you?&rdquo; asked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, worms and bugs that hide under the leaves,&rdquo; replied Chewink
      carelessly. &ldquo;You have no idea how many of them hide under dead leaves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you eat anything else?&rdquo; asked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Berries and wild fruits in season,&rdquo; replied Chewink. &ldquo;I'm very fond of
      them. They make a variety in the bill of fare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've noticed that I seldom see you up in the tree tops,&rdquo; remarked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like the ground better,&rdquo; replied Chewink. &ldquo;I spend more of my time on
      the ground than anywhere else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose that means that you nest on the ground,&rdquo; ventured Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chewink nodded. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;As a matter of fact, I've got a
      nest in this very thicket. Mrs. Towhee is on it right now, and I suspect
      she's worrying and anxious to know what happened over here when you warned
      me about Reddy Fox. I think I must go over and set her mind at rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter was just about to ask if he might go along and see that nest when a
      new voice broke in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you fellows talking about?&rdquo; it demanded, and there flitted just
      in front of Peter a little bird the size of a Sparrow but lovelier than
      any Sparrow of Peter's acquaintance. At first glance he seemed to be all
      blue, and such a lovely bright blue. But as he paused for an instant Peter
      saw that his wings and tail were mostly black and that the lovely blue was
      brightest on his head and back. It was Indigo the Bunting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were talking about our family,&rdquo; replied Chewink. &ldquo;I was telling Peter
      that we belong to the largest family among the birds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you didn't say anything about Indigo,&rdquo; interrupted Peter. &ldquo;Do you
      mean to say that he belongs to the same family?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I surely do,&rdquo; replied Indigo. &ldquo;I'm rather closely related to the Sparrow
      branch. Don't I look like a Sparrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter looked at Indigo closely. &ldquo;In size and shape you do,&rdquo; he confessed,
      &ldquo;but just the same I should never in the world have thought of connecting
      you with the Sparrows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about me?&rdquo; asked another voice, and a little brown bird flew up
      beside Indigo, twitching her tail nervously. She looked very Sparrow-like
      indeed, so much so, that if Peter had not seen her with her handsome mate,
      for she was Mrs. Indigo, he certainly would have taken her for a Sparrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only on her wings and tail was there any of the blue which made Indigo's
      coat so beautiful, and this was only a faint tinge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll have to confess that so far as you are concerned it isn't hard to
      think of you as related to the Sparrows,&rdquo; declared Peter. &ldquo;Don't you
      sometimes wish you were as handsomely dressed as Indigo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Indigo shook her head in a most decided way. &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; she declared.
      &ldquo;I have worries enough raising a family as it is, but if I had a coat like
      his I wouldn't have a moment of peace. You have no idea how I worry about
      him sometimes. You ought to be thankful, Peter Rabbit, that you haven't a
      coat like his. It attracts altogether too much attention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter tried to picture himself in a bright blue coat and laughed right out
      at the mere thought, and the others joined with him. Then Indigo flew up
      to the top of a tall tree not far away and began to sing. It was a lively
      song and Peter enjoyed it thoroughly. Mrs. Indigo took this opportunity to
      slip away unobserved, and when Peter looked around for Chewink, he too had
      disappeared. He had gone to tell Mrs. Chewink that he was quite safe and
      that she had nothing to worry about.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII. A Royal Dresser and a Late Nester.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Jenny and Mr. Wren were busy. If there were any busier little folks
      anywhere Peter Rabbit couldn't imagine who they could be. You see,
      everyone of those seven eggs in the Wren nest had hatched, and seven
      mouths are a lot to feed, especially when every morsel of food must be
      hunted for and carried from a distance. There was little time for gossip
      now. Just as soon as it was light enough to see Jenny and Mr. Wren began
      feeding those always hungry babies, and they kept at it with hardly time
      for an occasional mouthful themselves, until the Black Shadows came
      creeping out from the Purple Hills. Wren babies, like all other bird
      babies, grow very fast, and that means that each one of them must have a
      great deal of food every day. Each one of them often ate its own weight in
      food in a day and all their food had to be hunted for and when found
      carried back and put into the gaping little mouths. Hardly would Jenny
      Wren disappear in the little round doorway of her home with a caterpillar
      in her bill than she would hop out again, and Mr. Wren would take her
      place with a spider or a fly and then hurry away for something more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter tried to keep count of the number of times they came and went but
      soon gave it up as a bad job. He began to wonder where all the worms and
      bugs and spiders came from, and gradually he came to have a great deal of
      respect for eyes sharp enough to find them so quickly. Needless to say
      Jenny was shorter-tempered than ever. She had no time to gossip and said
      so most emphatically. So at last Peter gave up the idea of trying to find
      out from her certain things he wanted to know, and hopped off to look for
      some one who was less busy. He had gone but a short distance when his
      attention was caught by a song so sweet and so full of little trills that
      he first stopped to listen, then went to look for the singer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It didn't take long to find him, for he was sitting on the very tiptop of
      a fir-tree in Farmer Brown's yard. Peter didn't dare go over there, for
      already it was broad daylight, and he had about made up his mind that he
      would have to content himself with just listening to that sweet singer
      when the latter flew over in the Old Orchard and alighted just over
      Peter's head. &ldquo;Hello, Peter!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Linnet!&rdquo; cried Peter. &ldquo;I was wondering who it could be who was
      singing like that. I ought to have known, but you see it's so long since
      I've heard you sing that I couldn't just remember your song. I'm so glad
      you came over here for I'm just dying to talk to somebody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Linnet the Purple Finch, for this is who it was, laughed right out. &ldquo;I see
      you're still the same old Peter,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I suppose you're just as full
      of curiosity as ever and just as full of questions. Well, here I am, so
      what shall we talk about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You,&rdquo; replied Peter bluntly. &ldquo;Lately I've found out so many surprising
      things about my feathered friends that I want to know more. I'm trying to
      get it straight in my head who is related to who, and I've found out some
      things which have begun to make me feel that I know very little about my
      feathered neighbors. It's getting so that I don't dare to even guess who a
      person's relatives are. If you please, Linnet, what family do you belong
      to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Linnet flew down a little nearer to Peter. &ldquo;Look me over, Peter,&rdquo; said he
      with twinkling eyes. &ldquo;Look me over and see if you can't tell for
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter stared solemnly at Linnet. He saw a bird of Sparrow size most of
      whose body was a rose-red, brightest on the head, darkest on the back, and
      palest on the breast. Underneath he was whitish.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wings and tail were brownish, the outer parts of the feathers edged
      with rose-red. His bill was short and stout.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Peter could reply, Mrs. Linnet appeared. There wasn't so much as a
      touch of that beautiful rose-red about her. Her grayish-brown back was
      streaked with black, and her white breast and sides were spotted and
      streaked with brown. If Peter hadn't seen her with Linnet he certainly
      would have taken her for a Sparrow. She looked so much like one that he
      ventured to say, &ldquo;I guess you belong to the Sparrow family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's pretty close, Peter. That's pretty close,&rdquo; declared Linnet. &ldquo;We
      belong to the Finch branch of the family, which makes the sparrows own
      cousins to us. Folks may get Mrs. Linnet mixed with some of our Sparrow
      cousins, but they never can mistake me. There isn't anybody else my size
      with a rose-red coat like mine. If you can't remember my song, which you
      ought to, because there is no other song quite like it, you can always
      tell me by the color of my coat. Hello! Here comes Cousin Chicoree. Did
      you ever see a happier fellow than he is? I'll venture to say that he has
      been having such a good time that he hasn't even yet thought of building a
      nest, and here half the people of the Old Orchard have grown families.
      I've a nest and eggs myself, but that madcap is just roaming about having
      a good time. Isn't that so, Chicoree?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't what so?&rdquo; demanded Chicoree the Goldfinch, perching very near to
      where Linnet was sitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't it true that you haven't even begun thinking about a nest?&rdquo;
       demanded Linnet. Chicoree flew down in the grass almost under Peter's nose
      and began to pull apart a dandelion which had gone to seed. He snipped the
      seeds from the soft down to which they were attached and didn't say a word
      till he was quite through. Then he flew up in the tree near Linnet, and
      while he dressed his feathers, answered Linnet's question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's quite true, but what of it?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;There's time enough to think
      about nest-building and household cares later. Mrs. Goldfinch and I will
      begin to think about them about the first of July. Meanwhile we are making
      the most of this beautiful season to roam about and have a good time. For
      one thing we like thistledown to line our nest, and there isn't any
      thistledown yet. Then, there is no sense in raising a family until there
      is plenty of the right kind of food, and you know we Goldfinches live
      mostly on seeds. I'll venture to say that we are the greatest seed-eaters
      anywhere around. Of course when the babies are small they have to have
      soft food, but one can find plenty of worms and bugs any time during the
      summer. Just as soon as the children are big enough to hunt their own food
      they need seeds, so there is no sense in trying to raise a family until
      there are plenty of seeds for them when needed. Meanwhile we are having a
      good time. How do you like my summer suit, Peter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's beautiful,&rdquo; cried Peter. &ldquo;I wouldn't know you for the same bird I
      see so often in the late fall and sometimes in the winter. I don't know of
      anybody who makes a more complete change. That black cap certainly is very
      smart and becoming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chicoree cocked his head on one side, the better to show off that black
      cap. The rest of his head and his whole body were bright yellow. His wings
      were black with two white bars on each. His tail also was black, with some
      white on it. In size he was a little smaller than Linnet and altogether
      one of the smartest appearing of all the little people who wear feathers.
      It was a joy just to look at him. If Peter had known anything about
      Canaries, which of course he didn't, because Canaries are always kept in
      cages, he would have understood why Chicoree the Goldfinch is often called
      the Wild Canary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Goldfinch now joined her handsome mate and it was plain to see that
      she admired him quite as much as did Peter. Her wings and tail were much
      like his but were more brownish than black. She wore no cap it all and her
      back and head were a grayish-brown with an olive tinge. Underneath she was
      lighter, with a tinge of yellow. All together she was a very modestly
      dressed small person. As Peter recalled Chicoree's winter suit, it was
      very much like that now worn by Mrs. Goldfinch, save that his wings and
      tail were as they now appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the time Chicoree kept up a continual happy twittering, breaking out
      every few moments into song. It was clear that he was fairly bubbling over
      with joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;it sounds foolish of me to ask if you are a
      member of the same family as Linnet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very foolish, Peter. Very foolish,&rdquo; laughed Chicoree. &ldquo;Isn't my name
      Goldfinch, and isn't his name Purple Finch? We belong to the same family
      and a mighty fine family it is. Now I must go over to the Old Pasture to
      see how the thistles are coming on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Away he flew calling, &ldquo;Chic-o-ree, per-chic-o-ree, chic-o-ree!&rdquo; Mrs.
      Goldfinch followed. As they flew, they rose and fell in the air in very
      much the same way that Yellow Wing the Flicker does.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd know them just by that, even if Chicoree didn't keep calling his own
      name,&rdquo; thought Peter. &ldquo;It's funny how they often stay around all winter
      yet are among the last of all the birds to set up housekeeping. As I once
      said to Jenny Wren, birds certainly are funny creatures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, tut, tut, tut, tut! It's no such thing, Peter Rabbit. It's no such
      thing,&rdquo; scolded Jenny Wren as she flew last Peter on her way to hunt for
      another worm for her hungry babies.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER, XXXIV. Mourner the Dove and Cuckoo.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A long lane leads from Farmer Brown's barnyard down to his cornfield on
      the Green Meadows. It happened that very early one morning Peter Rabbit
      took it into his funny little head to run down that long lane to see what
      he might see. Now at a certain place beside that long lane was a gravelly
      bank into which Farmer Brown had dug for gravel to put on the roadway up
      near his house. As Peter was scampering past this place where Farmer Brown
      had dug he caught sight of some one very busy in that gravel pit. Peter
      stopped short, then sat up to stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Mourner the Dove whom Peter saw, an old friend of whom Peter is
      very fond. His body was a little bigger than that of Welcome Robin, but
      his long slender neck, and longer tail and wings made him appear
      considerably larger. In shape he reminded Peter at once of the Pigeons up
      at Farmer Brown's. His back was grayish-brown, varying to bluish-gray. The
      crown and upper parts of his head were bluish-gray. His breast was
      reddish-buff, shading down into a soft buff. His bill was black and his
      feet red. The two middle feathers of his tail were longest and of the
      color of his back. The other feathers were slaty-gray with little black
      bands and tipped with white. On his wings were a few scattered black
      spots. Just under each ear was a black spot. But it was the sides of his
      slender neck which were the most beautiful part of Mourner. When untouched
      by the Jolly Little Sunbeams the neck feathers appeared to be in color
      very like his breast, but the moment they were touched by the Jolly Little
      Sunbeams they seemed to be constantly changing, which, as you know, is
      called iridescence. Altogether Mourner was lovely in a quiet way.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was not his appearance which made Peter stare; it was what he was
      doing. He was walking about and every now and then picking up something
      quite as if he were getting his breakfast in that gravel pit, and Peter
      couldn't imagine anything good to eat down there. He knew that there were
      not even worms there. Besides, Mourner is not fond of worms; he lives
      almost altogether on seeds and grains of many kinds. So Peter was puzzled.
      But as you know he isn't the kind to puzzle long over anything when he can
      use his tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Mourner!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;What under the sun are you doing in there?
      Are you getting your breakfast?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly, Peter; hardly,&rdquo; cooed Mourner in the softest of voices. &ldquo;I've had
      my breakfast and now I'm picking up a little gravel for my digestion.&rdquo; He
      picked up a tiny pebble and swallowed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of all things!&rdquo; cried Peter. &ldquo;You must be crazy. The idea of
      thinking that gravel is going to help your digestion. I should say the
      chances are that it will work just the other way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mourner laughed. It was the softest of little cooing laughs, very pleasant
      to hear. &ldquo;I see that as usual you are judging others by yourself,&rdquo; said
      he. &ldquo;You ought to know by this time that you can do nothing more foolish.
      I haven't the least doubt that a breakfast of gravel would give you the
      worst kind of a stomach-ache. But you are you and I am I, and there is all
      the difference in the world. You know I eat grain and hard seeds. Not
      having any teeth I have to swallow them whole. One part of my stomach is
      called a gizzard and its duty is to grind and crush my food so that it may
      be digested. Tiny pebbles and gravel help grind the food and so aid
      digestion. I think I've got enough now for this morning, and it is time
      for a dust bath. There is a dusty spot over in the lane where I take a
      dust bath every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don't mind,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;I'll go with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mourner said he didn't mind, so Peter followed him over to the dusty place
      in the long lane. There Mourner was joined by Mrs. Dove, who was dressed
      very much like him save that she did not have so beautiful a neck. While
      they thoroughly dusted themselves they chatted with Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you on the ground so much that I've often wondered if you build
      your nest on the ground,&rdquo; said Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Mourner. &ldquo;Mrs. Dove builds in a tree, but usually not very
      far above the ground. Now if you'll excuse us we must get back home. Mrs.
      Dove has two eggs to sit on and while she is siting I like to be close at
      hand to keep her company and make love to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Doves shook the loose dust from their feathers and flew away. Peter
      watched to see where they went, but lost sight of them behind some trees,
      so decided to run up to the Old Orchard. There he found Jenny and Mr. Wren
      as busy as ever feeding that growing family of theirs. Jenny wouldn't stop
      an instant to gossip. Peter was so brimful of what he had found out about
      Mr. and Mrs. Dove that he just had to tell some one. He heard Kitty the
      Catbird meowing among the bushes along the old stone wall, so hurried over
      to look for him. As soon as he found him Peter began to tell what he had
      learned about Mourner the Dove.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's no news, Peter,&rdquo; interrupted Kitty. &ldquo;I know all about Mourner and
      his wife. They are very nice people, though I must say Mrs. Dove is one of
      the poorest housekeepers I know of. I take it you never have seen her
      nest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter shook his head. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I haven't. What is it like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty the Catbird laughed. &ldquo;It's about the poorest apology for a nest I
      know of,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It is made of little sticks and mighty few of them.
      How they hold together is more than I can understand. I guess it is a good
      thing that Mrs. Dove doesn't lay more than two eggs, and it's a wonder to
      me that those two stay in the nest. Listen! There's Mourner's voice now.
      For one who is so happy he certainly does have the mournfullest sounding
      voice. To hear him you'd think he was sorrowful instead of happy. It
      always makes me feel sad to hear him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's true,&rdquo; replied Peter, &ldquo;but I like to hear him just the same.
      Hello! Who's that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From one of the trees in the Old Orchard sounded a long, clear,
      &ldquo;Kow-kow-kow-kow-kow-kow!&rdquo; It was quite unlike any voice Peter had heard
      that spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's Cuckoo,&rdquo; said Kitty. &ldquo;Do you mean to say you don't know Cuckoo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I know him,&rdquo; retorted Peter. &ldquo;I had forgotten the sound of his
      voice, that's all. Tell me, Kitty, is it true that Mrs. Cuckoo is no
      better than Sally Sly the Cowbird and goes about laying her eggs in the
      nests of other birds? I've heard that said of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn't a word of truth in it,&rdquo; declared Kitty emphatically. &ldquo;She
      builds a nest, such as it is, which isn't much, and she looks after her
      own children. The Cuckoos have been given a bad name because of some
      good-for-nothing cousins of theirs who live across the ocean where Bully
      the English Sparrow belongs, and who, if all reports are true, really are
      no better than Sally Sly the Cowbird. It's funny how a bad name sticks.
      The Cuckoos have been accused of stealing the eggs of us other birds, but
      I've never known them to do it and I've lived neighbor to them for a long
      time, I guess they get their bad name because of their habit of slipping
      about silently and keeping out of sight as much as possible, as if they
      were guilty of doing something wrong and trying to keep from being seen.
      As a matter of fact, they are mighty useful birds. Farmer Brown ought to
      be tickled to death that Mr. and Mrs. Cuckoo have come back to the Old
      Orchard this year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; demanded Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see that cobwebby nest with all those hairy caterpillars on it and
      around it up in that tree?&rdquo; asked Kitty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter replied that he did and that he had seen a great many nests just
      like it, and had noticed how the caterpillars ate all the leaves near
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll venture to say that you won't see very many leaves eaten around that
      nest,&rdquo; replied Kitty. &ldquo;Those are called tent-caterpillars, and they do an
      awful lot of damage. I can't bear them myself because they are so hairy,
      and very few birds will touch them. But Cuckoo likes them. There he comes
      now; just watch him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A long, slim Dove-like looking bird alighted close to the caterpillar's
      nest. Above he was brownish-gray with just a little greenish tinge.
      Beneath he was white. His wings were reddish-brown. His tail was a little
      longer than that of Mourner the Dove. The outer feathers were black tipped
      with white, while the middle feathers were the color of his back. The
      upper half of his bill was black, but the under half was yellow, and from
      this he is called the Yellow-billed Cuckoo. He has a cousin very much like
      himself in appearance, save that his bill is all black and he is listed
      the Black-billed Cuckoo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cuckoo made no sound but began to pick off the hairy caterpillars and
      swallow them. When he had eaten all those in sight he made holes in the
      silken web of the nest and picked out the caterpillars that were inside.
      Finally, having eaten his fill, he flew off as silently as he had come and
      disappeared among the bushes farther along the old stone wall. A moment
      later they heard his voice, &ldquo;Kow-kow-how-kow-kow-kow-kow-kow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose some folks would think that it is going to rain,&rdquo; remarked
      Kitty the Catbird. &ldquo;They have the silly notion that Cuckoo only calls just
      before rain, and so they call him the Rain Crow. But that isn't so at all.
      Well, Peter, I guess I've gossiped enough for one morning. I must go see
      how Mrs. Catbird is getting along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty disappeared and Peter, having no one to talk to, decided that the
      best thing he could do would be to go home to the dear Old Briar-patch.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXV. A Butcher and a Hummer.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Not far from the Old Orchard grew a thorn-tree which Peter Rabbit often
      passed. He never had paid particular attention to it. One morning he
      stopped to rest under it. Happening to look up, he saw a most astonishing
      thing. Fastened on the sharp thorns of one of the branches were three big
      grasshoppers, a big moth, two big caterpillars, a lizard, a small mouse
      and a young English Sparrow. Do you wonder that Peter thought he must be
      dreaming? He couldn't imagine how those creatures could have become
      fastened on those long sharp thorns. Somehow it gave him an uncomfortable
      feeling and he hurried on to the Old Orchard, bubbling over with desire to
      tell some one of the strange and dreadful thing he had seen in the
      thorn-tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he entered the Old Orchard in the far corner he saw Johnny Chuck
      sitting on his doorstep and hurried over to tell him the strange news.
      Johnny listened until Peter was through, then told him quite frankly that
      never had he heard of such a thing, and that he thought Peter must have
      been dreaming and didn't know it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're wrong, Johnny Chuck. Peter hasn't been dreaming at all,&rdquo; said
      Skimmer the Swallow, who, you remember, lived in a hole in a tree just
      above the entrance to Johnny Chuck's house. He had been sitting where he
      could hear all that Peter had said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you know so much about it, please explain,&rdquo; said Johnny Chuck
      rather crossly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's simple enough,&rdquo; replied Skimmer. &ldquo;Peter just happened to find the
      storehouse of Butcher the Loggerhead Shrike. It isn't a very pleasant
      sight, I must admit, but one must give Butcher credit for being smart
      enough to lay up a store of food when it is plentiful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who is Butcher the Shrike?&rdquo; demanded Peter. &ldquo;He's a new one to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's new to this location,&rdquo; replied Skimmer, &ldquo;and you probably haven't
      noticed him. I've seen him in the South often. There he is now, on the
      tiptop of that tree over yonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter and Johnny looked eagerly. They saw a bird who at first glance
      appeared not unlike Mocker the Mockingbird. He was dressed wholly in
      black, gray and white. When he turned his head they noticed a black stripe
      across the side of his face and that the tip of his bill was hooked. These
      are enough to make them forget that otherwise he was like Mocker. While
      they were watching him he flew down into the grass and picked up a
      grasshopper. Then he flew with a steady, even flight, only a little above
      the ground, for some distance, suddenly shooting up and returning to the
      perch where they had first seen him. There he ate the grasshopper and
      resumed his watch for something else to catch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He certainly has wonderful eyes,&rdquo; said Skimmer admiringly. &ldquo;He mast have
      seen that grasshopper way over there in the grass before he started after
      it, for he flew straight there. He doesn't waste time and energy hunting
      aimlessly. He sits on a high perch and watches until he sees something he
      wants. Many times I've seen him sitting on top of a telegraph pole. I
      understand that Bully the English Sparrow has become terribly nervous
      since the arrival of Butcher. He is particularly fond of English Sparrows.
      I presume it was one of Bully's children you saw in the thorn-tree, Peter.
      For my part I hope he'll frighten Bully into leaving the Old Orchard. It
      would be a good thing for the rest of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't understand yet why he fastens his victims on those long
      thorns,&rdquo; said Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For two reasons,&rdquo; replied Skimmer. &ldquo;When he catches more grasshoppers and
      other insects than he can eat, he sticks them on those thorns so that
      later he may be sure of a good meal if it happens there are no more to be
      caught when he is hungry. Mice, Sparrows, and things too big for him to
      swallow he sticks on the thorns so that he can pull them to pieces easier.
      You see his feet and claws are not big and stout enough to hold his
      victims while he tears them to pieces with his hooked bill. Sometimes,
      instead of sticking them on thorns, he sticks them on the barbed wire of a
      fence and sometimes he wedges them into the fork of two branches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he kill many birds?&rdquo; asked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not many,&rdquo; replied Skimmer, &ldquo;and most of those he does kill are English
      Sparrows. The rest of us have learned to keep out of his way. He feeds
      mostly on insects, worms and caterpillars, but he is very fond of mice and
      he catches a good many. He is a good deal like Killy the Sparrow Hawk in
      this respect. He has a cousin, the Great Northern Shrike, who sometimes
      comes down in the winter, and is very much like him. Hello! Now what's
      happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A great commotion had broken out not far away in the Old Orchard.
      Instantly Skimmer flew over to see what it was all about and Peter
      followed. He got there just in time to see Chatterer the Red Squirrel
      dodging around the trunk of a tree, first on one side, then on the other,
      to avoid the sharp bills of the angry feathered folk who had discovered
      him trying to rob a nest of its young.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter chuckled. &ldquo;Chatterer is getting just what is due him, I guess,&rdquo; he
      muttered. &ldquo;It reminds me of the time I got into a Yellow Jacket's nest.
      My, but those birds are mad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chatterer continued to dodge from side to side of the tree while the birds
      darted down at him, all screaming at the top of their voices. Finally
      Chatterer saw his chance to run for the old stone wall. Only one bird was
      quick enough to catch up with him and that one was such a tiny fellow that
      he seemed hardly bigger than a big insect. It was Hammer the Hummingbird.
      He followed Chatterer clear to the old stone wall. A moment later Peter
      heard a humming noise just over his head and looked up to see Hummer
      himself alight on a twig, where he squeaked excitedly for a few minutes,
      for his voice is nothing but a little squeak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often Peter had seen Hummer darting about from flower to flower and
      holding himself still in mid-air in front of each as he thrust his long
      bill into the heart of the blossom to get the tiny insects there and the
      sweet juices he is so fond of. But this was the first time Peter had ever
      seen him sitting still. He was such a mite of a thing that it was hard to
      realize that he was a bird. His back was a bright, shining green. His
      wings and tail were brownish with a purplish tinge. Underneath he was
      whitish, But it was his throat on which Peter fixed his eyes. It was a
      wonderful ruby-red that glistened and shone in the sun like a jewel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hummer lifted one wing and with his long needle-like bill smoothed the
      feathers under it. Then he darted out into the air, his wings moving so
      fast that Peter couldn't see them at all. But if he couldn't see them he
      could hear them. You see they moved so fast that they made a sound very
      like the humming of Bumble the Bee. It is because of this that he is
      called the Hummingbird. A fey' minutes later he was back again and now he
      was joined by Mrs. Hummer. She was dressed very much like Hummer but did
      not have the beautiful ruby throat. She stopped only a minute or two, then
      darted over to what looked for all the world like a tiny cup of moss. It
      was their nest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then Jenny Wren came along, and being quite worn out with the work of
      feeding her seven babies, she was content to rest for a few moments and
      gossip. Peter told her what he had discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know all about that,&rdquo; retorted Jenny. &ldquo;You don't suppose I hunt these
      trees over for food without knowing where my neighbors are living, do you?
      I'd have you to understand, Peter, that that is the daintiest nest in the
      Old Orchard. It is made wholly of plant down and covered on the outside
      with bits of that gray moss-like stuff that grows on the bark of the trees
      and is called lichens. That is what makes that nest look like nothing more
      than a knot on the branch. Chatterer made a big mistake when he visited
      this tree. Hummer may be a tiny fellow but he isn't afraid of anybody
      under the sun. That bill of his is so sharp and he is so quick that few
      folks ever bother him more than once. Why, there isn't a single member of
      the Hawk family that Hummer won't attack. There isn't a cowardly feather
      on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he go very far south for the winter?&rdquo; asked Peter. &ldquo;He is such a
      tiny fellow I don't see how he can stand a very long journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; exclaimed Jenny Wren. &ldquo;Distance doesn't bother Hummer any. You
      needn't worry about those wings of his. He goes clear down to South
      America. He has ever so many relatives down there. You ought to see his
      babies when they first hatch out. They are no bigger than bees. But they
      certainly do grow fast. Why, they are flying three weeks from the time
      they hatch. I'm glad I don't have to pump food down the throats of my
      youngsters the way Mrs. Hummingbird has to down hers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter looked perplexed. &ldquo;What do you mean by pumping food down their
      throats?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just what I say,&rdquo; retorted Jenny Wren. &ldquo;Mrs. Hummer sticks her bill right
      down their throats and then pumps up the food she has already swallowed. I
      guess it is a good thing that the babies have short bills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do they?&rdquo; asked Peter, opening his eyes very wide with surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Jenny. &ldquo;When they hatch out they have short bills, but it
      doesn't take them a great while to grow long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many babies does Mrs. Hummer usually have?&rdquo; asked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just two,&rdquo; replied Jenny. &ldquo;Just two. That's all that nest will hold. But
      goodness gracious, Peter, I can't stop gossiping here any longer. You have
      no idea what a care seven babies are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a jerk of her tail off flew Jenny Wren, and Peter hurried back to
      tell Johnny Chuck all he had found out about Hummer the Hummingbird.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVI. A Stranger and a Dandy.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Butcher the Shrike was not the only newcomer in the Old Orchard. There was
      another stranger who, Peter Rabbit soon discovered, was looked on with
      some suspicion by all the other birds of the Old Orchard. The first time
      Peter saw him, he was walking about on the ground some distance off. He
      didn't hop but walked, and at that distance he looked all black. The way
      he carried himself and his movements as he walked made Peter think of
      Creaker the Grackle. In fact, Peter mistook him for Creaker. That was
      because he didn't really look at him. If he had he would have seen at once
      that the stranger was smaller than Creaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the stranger flew up in a tree and Peter saw that his tail was
      little more than half as long as that of Creaker. At once it came over
      Peter that this was a stranger to him, and of course his curiosity was
      aroused. He didn't have any doubt whatever that this was a member of the
      Blackbird family, but which one it could be he hadn't the least idea.
      &ldquo;Jenny Wren will know,&rdquo; thought Peter and scampered off to hunt her up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that new member of the Blackbird family who has come to live in
      the Old Orchard?&rdquo; Peter asked as soon as he found Jenny Wren.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn't any new member of the Blackbird family living in the Old
      Orchard,&rdquo; retorted Jenny Wren tartly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is too,&rdquo; contradicted Peter. &ldquo;I saw him with my own eyes. I can see
      him now. He's sitting in that tree over yonder this very minute. He's all
      black, so of course he must be a member of the Blackbird family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, tut, tut, tut, tut!&rdquo; scolded Jenny Wren. &ldquo;Tut, tut, tut, tut, tut!
      That fellow isn't a member of the Blackbird family at all, and what's
      more, he isn't black. Go over there and take a good look at him; then come
      back and tell me if you still think he is black.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jenny turned her back on Peter and went to hunting worms. There being
      nothing else to do, Peter hopped over where he could get a good look at
      the stranger. The sun was shining full on him, and he wasn't black at all.
      Jenny Wren was right. For the most part he was very dark green. At least,
      that is what Peter thought at first glance. Then, as the stranger moved,
      he seemed to be a rich purple in places. In short he changed color as he
      turned. His feathers were like those of Creaker the Grackle&mdash;iridescent.
      All over he was speckled with tiny light spots. Underneath he was dark
      brownish-gray. His wings and tail were of the same color, with little
      touches of buff. His rather large bill was yellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter hurried back to Jenny Wren and it must be confessed he looked
      sheepish. &ldquo;You were right, Jenny Wren; he isn't black at all,&rdquo; confessed
      Peter. &ldquo;Of course I was right. I usually am,&rdquo; retorted Jenny. &ldquo;He isn't
      black, he isn't even related to the Blackbird family, and he hasn't any
      business in the Old Orchard. In fact, if you ask me, he hasn't any
      business in this country anyway. He's a foreigner. That's what he is&mdash;a
      foreigner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you haven't told me who he is,&rdquo; protested Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is Speckles the Starling, and he isn't really an American at all,&rdquo;
       replied Jenny. &ldquo;He comes from across the ocean the same as Bully the
      English Sparrow. Thank goodness he hasn't such a quarrelsome disposition
      as Bully. Just the same, the rest of us would be better satisfied if he
      were not here. He has taken possession of one of the old homes of Yellow
      Wing the Flicker, and that means one less house for birds who really
      belong here. If his family increases at the rate Bully's family does, I'm
      afraid some of us will soon be crowded out of the Old Orchard. Did you
      notice that yellow bill of his?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter nodded. &ldquo;I certainly did,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I couldn't very well help
      noticing it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there's a funny thing about that bill,&rdquo; replied Jenny. &ldquo;In winter
      it turns almost black. Most of us wear a different colored suit in winter,
      but our bills remain the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he seems to be pretty well fixed here, and I don't see but what the
      thing for the rest of you birds to do is to make the best of the matter,&rdquo;
       said Peter. &ldquo;What I want to know is whether or not he is of any use.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess he must do some good,&rdquo; admitted Jenny Wren rather grudgingly.
      &ldquo;I've seen him picking up worms and grubs, but he likes grain, and I have
      a suspicion that if his family becomes very numerous, and I suspect it
      will, they will eat more of Farmer Brown's grain than they will pay for by
      the worms and bugs they destroy. Hello! There's Dandy the Waxwing and his
      friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A flock of modestly dressed yet rather distinguished looking feathered
      folks had alighted in a cherry-tree and promptly began to help themselves
      to Farmer Brown's cherries. They were about the size of Winsome Bluebird,
      but did not look in the least like him, for they were dressed almost
      wholly in beautiful, rich, soft grayish-brown. Across the end of each tail
      was a yellow band. On each, the forehead, chin and a line through each eye
      was velvety-black. Each wore a very stylish pointed cap, and on the wings
      of most of them were little spots of red which looked like sealing-wax,
      and from which they get the name of Waxwings. They were slim and trim and
      quite dandified, and in a quiet way were really beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Peter watched them he began to wonder if Farmer Brown would have any
      cherries left. Peter himself can do pretty well in the matter of stuffing
      his stomach, but even he marvelled at the way those birds put the cherries
      out of sight. It was quite clear to him why they are often called
      Cherrybirds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they stay long, Farmer Brown won't have any cherries left,&rdquo; remarked
      Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't worry,&rdquo; replied Jenny Wren. &ldquo;They won't stay long. I don't know
      anybody equal to them for roaming about. Here are most of us with families
      on our hands and Mr. and Mrs. Bluebird with a second family and Mr. and
      Mrs. Robin with a second set of eggs, while those gadabouts up there
      haven't even begun to think about housekeeping yet. They certainly do like
      those cherries, but I guess Farmer Brown can stand the loss of what they
      eat. He may have fewer cherries, but he'll have more apples because of
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bow's that?&rdquo; demanded Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; replied Jenny Wren, &ldquo;they were over here a while ago when those
      little green cankerworms threatened to eat up the whole orchard, and they
      stuffed themselves on those worms just the same as they are stuffing
      themselves on cherries now. They are very fond of small fruits but most of
      those they eat are the wild kind which are of no use at all to Farmer
      Brown or anybody else. Now just look at that performance, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were five of the Waxwings and they were now seated side by side on a
      branch of the cherry tree. One of them had a plump cherry which he passed
      to the next one. This one passed it on to the next, and so it went to the
      end of the row and halfway back before it was finally eaten. Peter laughed
      right out. &ldquo;Never in my life have I seen such politeness,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; exclaimed Jenny Wren. &ldquo;I don't believe it was politeness at all. I
      guess if you got at the truth of the matter you would find that each one
      was stuffed so full that he thought he didn't have room for that cherry
      and so passed it along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I think that was politeness just the same,&rdquo; retorted Peter. &ldquo;The
      first one might have dropped the cherry if he couldn't eat it instead of
      passing it along.&rdquo; Just then the Waxwings flew away.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the very middle of the summer before Peter Rabbit again saw Dandy
      the Waxwing. Quite by chance he discovered Dandy sitting on the tiptop of
      an evergreen tree, as if on guard. He was on guard, for in that tree was
      his nest, though Peter didn't know it at the time. In fact, it was so late
      in the summer that most of Peter's friends were through nesting and he had
      quite lost interest in nests. Presently Dandy flew down to a lower branch
      and there he was joined by Mrs. Waxwing. Then Peter was treated to one of
      the prettiest sights he ever had seen. They rubbed their bills together as
      if kissing. They smoothed each other's feathers and altogether were a
      perfect picture of two little lovebirds. Peter couldn't think of another
      couple who appeared quite so gentle and loving.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late in the fall Peter saw Mr. and Mrs. Waxwing and their family together.
      They were in a cedar tree and were picking off and eating the cedar
      berries as busily as the five Waxwings had picked Farmer Brown's cherries
      in the early summer. Peter didn't know it but because of their fondness
      for cedar berries the Waxwings were often called Cedarbirds or Cedar
      Waxwings.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVII. Farewells and Welcomes.
    </h2>
    <p>
      All through the long summer Peter Rabbit watched his feathered friends and
      learned things in regard to their ways he never had suspected. As he saw
      them keeping the trees of the Old Orchard free of insect pests working in
      Farmer Brown's garden, and picking up the countless seeds of weeds
      everywhere, he began to understand something of the wonderful part these
      feathered folks have in keeping the Great World beautiful and worth while
      living in.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had many a hearty laugh as he watched the bird babies learn to fly and
      to find their own food. All summer long they were going to school all
      about him, learning how to watch out for danger, to use their eyes and
      ears, and all the things a bird must know who would live to grow up.
    </p>
    <p>
      As autumn drew near Peter discovered that his friends were gathering in
      flocks, roaming here and there. It was one of the first signs that summer
      was nearly over, and it gave him just a little feeling of sadness. He
      heard few songs now, for the singing season was over. Also he discovered
      that many of the most beautifully dressed of his feathered friends had
      changed their finery for sober traveling suits in preparation for the long
      journey to the far South where they would spend the winter. In fact he
      actually failed to recognize some of them at first.
    </p>
    <p>
      September came, and as the days grew shorter, some of Peter's friends bade
      him good-by. They were starting on the long journey, planning to take it
      in easy stages for the most part. Each day saw some slip away. As Peter
      thought of the dangers of the long trip before them he wondered if he
      would ever see them again. But some there were who lingered even after
      Jack Frost's first visit. Welcome and Mrs. Robin, Winsome and Mrs.
      Bluebird. Little Friend the Song Sparrow and his wife were among these. By
      and by even they were forced to leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sad indeed and lonely would these days have been for Peter had it not been
      that with the departure of the friends he had spent so many happy hours
      with came the arrival of certain other friends from the Far North where
      they had made their summer homes. Some of these stopped for a few days in
      passing. Others came to stay, and Peter was kept busy looking for and
      welcoming them.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few old friends there were who would stay the year through. Sammy Jay
      was one. Downy and Hairy the Woodpeckers were others. And one there was
      whom Peter loves dearly. It was Tommy Tit the Chickadee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Tommy Tit had not gone north in the spring. In fact, he had made his
      home not very far from the Old Orchard. It just happened that Peter hadn't
      found that home, and had caught only one or two glimpses of Tommy Tit.
      Now, with household cares ended and his good-sized family properly started
      in life, Tommy Tit was no longer interested in the snug little home he had
      built in a hollow birch-stub, and he and Mrs. Chickadee spent their time
      flitting about hither, thither, and yon, spreading good cheer. Every time
      Peter visited the Old Orchard he found him there, and as Tommy was always
      ready for a bit of merry gossip, Peter soon ceased to miss Jenny Wren.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you dread the winter, Tommy Tit?&rdquo; asked Peter one day, as he
      watched Tommy clinging head down to a twig as he picked some tiny insect
      eggs from the under side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; replied Tommy. &ldquo;I like winter. I like cold weather. It makes
      a fellow feel good from the tips of his claws to the tip of his bill. I'm
      thankful I don't have to take that long journey most of the birds have to.
      I discovered a secret a long time ago, Peter; shall I tell it to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, Tommy,&rdquo; cried Peter. &ldquo;You know how I love secrets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Tommy Tit, &ldquo;this is it: If a fellow keeps his stomach
      filled he will beep his toes warm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter looked a little puzzled. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;don't just see what your
      stomach has to do with your toes,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tommy Tit chuckled. It was a lovely throaty little chuckle. &ldquo;Dee, dee,
      dee!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;What I mean is, if a fellow has plenty to eat he will keep
      the cold out, and I've found that if a fellow uses his eyes and isn't
      afraid of a little work, he can find plenty to eat. At least I can. The
      only time I ever get really worried is when the trees are covered with
      ice. If it were not that Farmer Brown's boy is thoughtful enough to hang a
      piece of suet in a tree for me, I should dread those ice storms more than
      I do. As I said before, plenty of food keeps a fellow warm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it was your coat of feathers that kept you warm,&rdquo; said Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the feathers help,&rdquo; replied Tommy Tit. &ldquo;Food makes heat and a warm
      coat keeps the heat in the body. But the heat has got to be there first,
      or the feathers will do no good. It's just the same way with your own
      self, Peter. You know you are never really warm in winter unless you have
      plenty to eat...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; replied Peter thoughtfully. &ldquo;I never happened to think of it
      before. Just the same, I don't see how you find food enough on the trees
      when they are all bare in winter.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Dee, Dee, Chickadee!
     Leave that matter just to me,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Chuckled Tommy Tit. &ldquo;You ought to know by this time Peter Rabbit, that a
      lot of different kinds of bugs lay eggs on the twigs and trunks of trees.
      Those eggs would stay there all winter and in the spring hatch out into
      lice and worms if it were not for me. Why, sometimes in a single day I
      find and eat almost five hundred eggs of those little green plant lice
      that do so much damage in the spring and summer. Then there are little
      worms that bore in just under the bark, and there are other creatures who
      sleep the winter away in little cracks in the bark. Oh, there is plenty
      for me to do in the winter. I am one of the policemen of the trees. Downy
      and Hairy the Woodpeckers, Seep-Seep the Brown Creeper and Yank-Yank the
      Nuthatch are others. If we didn't stay right here on the job all winter, I
      don't know what would become of the Old Orchard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tommy Tit hung head downward from a twig while he picked some tiny insect
      eggs from the under side of it. It didn't seem to make the least
      difference to Tommy whether he was right side up or upside down. He was a
      little animated bunch of black and white feathers, not much bigger than
      Jenny Wren. The top of his head, back of his neck and coat were shining
      black. The sides of his head and neck were white. His back was ashy. His
      sides were a soft cream-buff, and his wing and tail feathers were edged
      with white. His tiny bill was black, and his little black eyes snapped and
      twinkled in a way good to see. Not one among all Peter's friends is such a
      merry-hearted little fellow as Tommy Tit the Chickadee. Merriment and
      happiness bubble out of him all the time, no matter what the weather is.
      He is the friend of everyone and seems to feel that everyone is his
      friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've noticed,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;that birds who do not sing at any other time
      of year sing in the spring. Do you have a spring song, Tommy Tit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't know as you would call it a song, Peter,&rdquo; chuckled Tommy.
      &ldquo;No, I hardly think you would call it a song. But I have a little love
      call then which goes like this: Phoe-be! Phoe-be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the softest, sweetest little whistle, and Tommy had rightly called
      it a love call. &ldquo;Why, I've often heard that in the spring and didn't know
      it was your voice at all,&rdquo; cried Peter. &ldquo;You say Phoebe plainer than does
      the bird who is named Phoebe, and it is ever so much softer and sweeter. I
      guess that is because you whistle it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you guess right,&rdquo; replied Tommy Tit. &ldquo;Now I can't stop to talk
      any longer. These trees need my attention. I want Farmer Brown's boy to
      feel that I have earned that suet I am sure he will put out for me as soon
      as the snow and ice come. I'm not the least bit afraid of Farmer Brown's
      boy. I had just as soon take food from his hand as from anywhere else. He
      knows I like chopped-up nut-meats, and last winter I used to feed from his
      hand every day.&rdquo; Peter's eyes opened very wide with surprise. &ldquo;Do you mean
      to say,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that you and Farmer Brown's boy are such friends that
      you dare sit on his hand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tommy Tit nodded his little black-capped head vigorously. &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo;
       said he. &ldquo;Why not? What's the good of having friends if you can't trust
      them? The more you trust them the better friends they'll be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just the same, I don't see how you dare to do it,&rdquo; Peter replied. &ldquo;I know
      Farmer Brown's boy is the friend of all the little people, and I'm not
      much afraid of him myself, but just the same I wouldn't dare go near
      enough for him to touch me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; retorted Tommy Tit. &ldquo;That's no way of showing true friendship.
      You've no idea, Peter, what a comfortable feeling it is to know that you
      can trust a friend, and I feel that Farmer Brown's boy is one of the best
      friends I've got. I wish more boys and girls were like him.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVIII. Honker and Dippy Arrive.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The leaves of the trees turned yellow and red and brown and then began to
      drop, a few at first, then more and more every day until all but the
      spruce-trees and the pine-trees and the hemlock-trees and the fir-trees
      and the cedar-trees were bare. By this time most of Peter's feathered
      friends of the summer had departed, and there were days when Peter had oh,
      such a lonely feeling. The fur of his coat was growing thicker. The grass
      of the Green Meadows had turned brown. All these things were signs which
      Peter knew well. He knew that rough Brother North Wind and Jack Frost were
      on their way down from the Far North.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter had few friends to visit now. Johnny Chuck had gone to sleep for the
      winter 'way down in his little bedroom under ground. Grandfather Frog had
      also gone to sleep. So had Old Mr. Toad. Peter spent a great deal of time
      in the dear Old Briar-patch just sitting still and listening. What he was
      listening for he didn't know. It just seemed to him that there was
      something he ought to hear at this time of year, and so he sat listening
      and listening and wondering what he was listening for. Then, late one
      afternoon, there came floating down to him from high up in the sky,
      faintly at first but growing louder, a sound unlike any Peter had heard
      all the long summer through. The sound was a voice. Rather it was many
      voices mingled &ldquo;Honk, honk, honk, honk, honk, honk, honk!&rdquo; Peter gave a
      little jump.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what I've been listening for!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Honker the Goose and his
      friends are coming. Oh, I do hope they will stop where I can pay them a
      call.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hopped out to the edge of the dear Old Briar-patch that he might see
      better, and looked up in the sky. High up, flying in the shape of a letter
      V, he saw a flock of great birds flying steadily from the direction of the
      Far North. By the sound of their voices he knew that they had flown far
      that day and were tired. One bird was in the lead and this he knew to be
      his old friend, Honker. Straight over his head they passed and as Peter
      listened to their voices he felt within him the very spirit of the Far
      North, that great, wild, lonely land which he had never seen but of which
      he had so often heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Peter watched, Honker suddenly turned and headed in the direction of
      the Big River. Then he began to slant down, his flock following him. And
      presently they disappeared behind the trees along the bank of the Great
      River. Peter gave a happy little sigh. &ldquo;They are going to spend the night
      there,&rdquo; thought he. &ldquo;When the moon comes up, I will run over there, for
      they will come ashore and I know just where. Now that they have arrived I
      know that winter is not far away. Honker's voice is as sure a sign of the
      coming of winter as is Winsome Bluebird's that spring will soon be here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter could hardly wait for the coming of the Black Shadows, and just as
      soon as they had crept out over the Green Meadows he started for the Big
      River. He knew just where to go, because he knew that Honker and his
      friends would rest and spend the night in the same place they had stopped
      at the year before. He knew that they would remain out in the middle of
      the Big River until the Black Shadows had made it quite safe for them to
      swim in. He reached the bank of the Big River just as sweet Mistress Moon
      was beginning to throw her silvery light over the Great World. There was a
      sandy bar in the Great River at this point, and Peter squatted on the bank
      just where this sandy bar began.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to Peter that he had sat there half the night, but really it was
      only a short time, before he heard a low signal out in the Black Shadows
      which covered the middle of the Big River. It was the voice of Honker.
      Then Peter saw little silvery lines moving on the water and presently a
      dozen great shapes appeared in the moonlight. Honker and his friends were
      swimming in. The long neck of each of those great birds was stretched to
      its full height, and Peter knew that each bird was listening for the
      slightest suspicious sound. Slowly they drew near, Honker in the lead.
      They were a picture of perfect caution. When they reached the sandy bar
      they remained quiet, looking and listening for some time. Then, sure that
      all was safe, Honker gave a low signal and at once a low gabbling began as
      the big birds relaxed their watchfulness and came out on the sandy bar,
      all save one. That one was the guard, and he remained with neck erect on
      watch. Some swam in among the rushes growing in the water very near to
      where Peter was sitting and began to feed. Others sat on the sandy bar and
      dressed their feathers. Honker himself came ashore close to where Peter
      was sitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Honker,&rdquo; cried Peter, &ldquo;I'm so glad you're back here safe and sound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Honker gave a little start, but instantly recognizing Peter, came over
      close to him. As he stood there in the moonlight he was truly handsome.
      His throat and a large patch on each side of his head were white. The rest
      of his head and long, slim neck were black. His short tail was also black.
      His back, wings, breast and sides were a soft grayish-brown. He was white
      around the base of his tail and he wore a white collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Peter,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It is good to have an old friend greet me. I
      certainly am glad to be back safe and sound, for the hunters with terrible
      guns have been at almost every one of our resting places, and it has been
      hard work to get enough to eat. It is a relief to find one place where
      there are no terrible guns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you come far?&rdquo; asked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very far, Peter; very far,&rdquo; replied Honker. &ldquo;And we still have very far
      to go. I shall be thankful when the journey is over, for on me depends the
      safety of all those with me, and it is a great responsibility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will winter soon be here?&rdquo; asked Peter eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rough Brother North Wind and Jack Frost were right behind us,&rdquo; replied
      Honker. &ldquo;You know we stay in the Far North just as long as we can. Already
      the place where we nested is frozen and covered with snow. For the first
      part of the journey we kept only just ahead of the snow and ice, but as we
      drew near to where men make their homes we were forced to make longer
      journeys each day, for the places where it is safe to feed and rest are
      few and far between. Now we shall hurry on until we reach the place in the
      far-away South where we will make our winter home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then Honker was interrupted by wild, strange sounds from the middle
      of the Great River. It sounded like crazy laughter. Peter jumped at the
      sound, but Honker merely chuckled. &ldquo;It's Dippy the Loon,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;He
      spent the summer in the Far North not far from us. He started south just
      before we did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish he would come in here so that I can get a good look at him and
      make his acquaintance,&rdquo; said Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may, but I doubt it,&rdquo; replied Honker. &ldquo;He and his mate are great
      people to keep by themselves. Then, too, they don't have to come ashore
      for food. You know Dippy feeds altogether on fish. He really has an easier
      time on the long journey than we do, because he can get his food without
      running so much risk of being shot by the terrible hunters. He practically
      lives on the water. He's about the most awkward fellow on land of any one
      I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should he be any more awkward on land then you?&rdquo; asked Peter, his
      curiosity aroused at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; replied Honker, &ldquo;Old Mother Nature has given him very short
      legs and has placed them so far back on his body that he can't keep his
      balance to walk, and has to use his wings and bill to help him over the
      ground. On shore he is about the most helpless thing you can imagine. But
      on water he is another fellow altogether. He's just as much at home under
      water as on top. My, how that fellow can dive! When he sees the flash of a
      gun he will get under water before the shot can reach him. That's where he
      has the advantage of us Geese. You know we can't dive. He could swim clear
      across this river under water if he wanted to, and he can go so fast under
      water that he can catch a fish. It is because his legs have been placed so
      far back that he can swim so fast. You know his feet are nothing but big
      paddles. Another funny thing is that he can sink right down in the water
      when he wants to, with nothing but his head out. I envy him that. It would
      be a lot easier for us Geese to escape the dreadful hunters if we could
      sink down that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he a bill like yours?&rdquo; asked Peter innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; replied Honker. &ldquo;Didn't I tell you that he lives on fish?
      How do you suppose he would hold on to his slippery fish if he had a broad
      bill like mine? His bill is stout, straight and sharp pointed. He is
      rather a handsome fellow. He is pretty nearly as big as I am, and his
      back, wings, tail and neck are black with bluish or greenish appearance in
      the sun. His back and wings are spotted with white, and there are streaks
      of white on his throat and the sides of his neck. On his breast and below
      he is all white. You certainly ought to get acquainted with Dippy, Peter,
      for there isn't anybody quite like him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd like to,&rdquo; replied Peter. &ldquo;But if he never comes to shore, how can I?
      I guess I will have to be content to know him just by his voice. I
      certainly never will forget that. It's about as crazy sounding as the
      voice of Old Man Coyote, and that is saying a great deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's one thing I forgot to tell you,&rdquo; said Honker. &ldquo;Dippy can't fly
      from the land; he must be on the water in order to get up in the air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can, can't you?&rdquo; asked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I can,&rdquo; replied Honker. &ldquo;Why, we Geese get a lot of our food on
      land. When it is safe to do so we visit the grain fields and pick up the
      grain that has been shaken out during harvest. Of course we couldn't do
      that if we couldn't fly from the land. We can rise from either land or
      water equally well. Now if you'll excuse me, Peter, I'll take a nap. My,
      but I'm tired! And I've got a long journey to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Peter politely bade Honker and his relatives good-night and left them
      in peace on the sandy bar in the Big River.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIX. Peter Discovers Two Old Friends.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Rough Brother North Wind and Jack Frost were not far behind Honker the
      Goose. In a night Peter Rabbit's world was transformed. It had become a
      new world, a world of pure white. The last laggard among Peter's feathered
      friends who spend the winter in the far-away South had hurried away. Still
      Peter was not lonely. Tommy Tit's cheery voice greeted Peter the very
      first thing that morning after the storm. Tommy seemed to be in just as
      good spirits as ever he had been in summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Peter rather likes the snow. He likes to run about in it, and so he
      followed Tommy Tit up to the Old Orchard. He felt sure that he would find
      company there besides Tommy Tit, and he was not disappointed. Downy and
      Hairy the Woodpeckers were getting their breakfast from a piece of suet
      Farmer Brown's boy had thoughtfully fastened in one of the apple-trees for
      them. Sammy Jay was there also, and his blue coat never had looked better
      than it did against the pure white of the snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were the only ones Peter really had expected to find in the Old
      Orchard, and so you can guess how pleased he was as he hopped over the old
      stone wall to hear the voice of one whom he had almost forgotten. It was
      the voice of Yank-Yank the Nuthatch, and while it was far from being sweet
      there was in it something of good cheer and contentment. At once Peter
      hurried in the direction from which it came.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the trunk of an apple-tree he caught sight of a gray and black and
      white bird about the size of Downy the Woodpecker. The top of his head and
      upper part of his back were shining black. The rest of his back was
      bluish-gray. The sides of his head and his breast were white. The outer
      feathers of his tail were black with white patches near their tips.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Peter didn't need to see how Yank-Yank was dressed in order to
      recognize him. Peter would have known him if he had been so far away that
      the colors of his coat did not show at all. You see, Yank-Yank was doing a
      most surprising thing, something no other bird can do. He was walking head
      first down the trunk of that tree, picking tiny eggs of insects from the
      bark and seemingly quite as much at home and quite as unconcerned in that
      queer position as if he were right side up.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Peter approached, Yank-Yank lifted his head and called a greeting which
      sounded very much like the repetition of his own name. Then he turned
      around and began to climb the tree as easily as he had come down it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Welcome home, Yank-Yank!&rdquo; cried Peter, hurrying up quite out of breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yank-Yank turned around so that he was once more head down, and his eyes
      twinkled as he looked down at Peter. &ldquo;You're mistaken Peter,&rdquo; said he.
      &ldquo;This isn't home. I've simply come down here for the winter. You know home
      is where you raise your children, and my home is in the Great Woods
      farther north. There is too much ice and snow up there, so I have come
      down here to spend the winter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well anyway, it's a kind of home; it's your winter home,&rdquo; protested
      Peter, &ldquo;and I certainly am glad to see you back. The Old Orchard wouldn't
      be quite the same without you. Did you have a pleasant summer? And if you
      please, Yank-Yank, tell me where you built your home and what it was
      like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mr. Curiosity, I had a very pleasant summer,&rdquo; replied Yank-Yank.
      &ldquo;Mrs. Yank-Yank and I raised a family of six and that is doing a lot
      better than some folks I know, if I do say it. As to our nest, it was made
      of leaves and feathers and it was in a hole in a certain old stump that
      not a soul knows of but Mrs. Yank-Yank and myself. Now is there anything
      else you want to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; retorted Peter promptly. &ldquo;I want to know how it is that you can
      walk head first down the trunk of a tree without losing your balance and
      tumbling off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yank-Yank chuckled happily. &ldquo;I discovered a long time ago, Peter,&rdquo; said
      he, &ldquo;that the people who get on best in this world are those who make the
      most of what they have and waste no time wishing they could have what
      other people have. I suppose you have noticed that all the Woodpecker
      family have stiff tail feathers and use them to brace themselves when they
      are climbing a tree. They have become so dependent on them that they don't
      dare move about on the trunk of a tree without using them. If they want to
      come down a tree they have to back down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now Old Mother Nature didn't give me stiff tail feathers, but she gave me
      a very good pair of feet with three toes in front and one behind and when
      I was a very little fellow I learned to make the most of those feet. Each
      toe has a sharp claw. When I go up a tree the three front claws on each
      foot hook into the bark. When I come down a tree I simply twist one foot
      around so that I can use the claws of this foot to keep me from falling.
      It is just as easy for me to go down a tree as it is to go up, and I can
      go right around the trunk just as easily and comfortably.&rdquo; Suiting action
      to the word, Yank-Yank ran around the trunk of the apple-tree just above
      Peter's head. When he reappeared Peter had another question ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you live altogether on grubs and worms and insects and their eggs?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say not!&rdquo; exclaimed Yank-Yank. &ldquo;I like acorns and beechnuts and
      certain kinds of seeds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see how such a little fellow as you can eat such hard things as
      acorns and beechnuts,&rdquo; protested Peter a little doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yank-Yank laughed right out. &ldquo;Sometime when I see you over in the Green
      Forest I'll show you,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;When I find a fat beechnut I take it to a
      little crack in a tree that will just hold it; then with this stout bill
      of mine I crack the shell. It really is quite easy when you know how.
      Cracking a nut open that way is sometimes called hatching, and that is how
      I come by the name of Nuthatch. Hello! There's Seep-Seep. I haven't seen
      him since we were together up North. His home was not far from mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Yank-Yank spoke, a little brown bird alighted at the very foot of the
      next tree. He was just a trifle bigger than Jenny Wren but not at all like
      Jenny, for while Jenny's tail usually is cocked up in the sauciest way,
      Seep-Seep's tail is never cocked up at all. In fact, it bends down, for
      Seep-Seep uses his tail just as the members of the Woodpecker family use
      theirs. He was dressed in grayish-brown above and grayish-white beneath.
      Across each wing was a little band of buffy-white, and his bill was curved
      just a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seep-Seep didn't stop an instant but started up the trunk of that tree,
      going round and round it as he climbed, and picking out things to eat from
      under the bark. His way of climbing that tree was very like creeping, and
      Peter thought to himself that Seep-Seep was well named the Brown Creeper.
      He knew it was quite useless to try to get Seep-Seep to talk, He knew that
      Seep-Seep wouldn't waste any time that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Round and round up the trunk of the tree he went, and when he reached the
      top at once flew down to the bottom of the next tree and without a pause
      started up that. He wasted no time exploring the branches, but stuck to
      the trunk. Once in a while he would cry in a thin little voice, &ldquo;Seep!
      Seep!&rdquo; but never paused to rest or look around. If he had felt that on him
      alone depended the job of getting all the insect eggs and grubs on those
      trees he could not have been more industrious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he build his nest in a hole in a tree?&rdquo; asked Peter of Yank-Yank.
      Yank-Yank shook his head. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;He hunts for a tree or stub
      with a piece of loose bark hanging to it. In behind this he tucks his nest
      made of twigs, strips of bark and moss. He's a funny little fellow and I
      don't know of any one in all the great world who more strictly attends to
      his own business than does Seep-Seep the Brown Creeper. By the way, Peter,
      have you seen anything of Dotty the Tree Sparrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; replied Peter, &ldquo;but I think he must be here. I'm glad you
      reminded me of him. I'll go look for him.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XL. Some Merry Seed-Eaters.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Having been reminded of Dotty the Tree Sparrow, Peter Rabbit became
      possessed of a great desire to find this little friend of the cold months
      and learn how he had fared through the summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was at a loss just where to look for Dotty until he remembered a
      certain weedy field along the edge of which the bushes had been left
      growing. &ldquo;Perhaps I'll find him there,&rdquo; thought Peter, for he remembered
      that Dotty lives almost wholly on seeds, chiefly weed seeds, and that he
      dearly loves a weedy field with bushes not far distant in which he can
      hide.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Peter hurried over to the weedy field and there, sure enough, he found
      Dotty with a lot of his friends. They were very busy getting their
      breakfast. Some were clinging to the weed-stalks picking the seeds out of
      the tops, while others were picking up the seeds from the ground. It was
      cold. Rough Brother North Wind was doing his best to blow up another
      snow-cloud. It wasn't at all the kind of day in which one would expect to
      find anybody in high spirits. But Dotty was. He was even singing as Peter
      came up, and all about Dotty's friends and relatives were twittering as
      happily and merrily as if it were the beginning of spring instead of
      winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dotty was very nearly the size of Little Friend the Song Sparrow and
      looked somewhat like him, save that his breast was clear ashy-gray, all
      but a little dark spot in the middle, the little dot from which he gets
      his name. He wore a chestnut cap, almost exactly like that of Chippy the
      Chipping Sparrow. It reminded Peter that Dotty is often called the Winter
      Chippy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Welcome back, Dotty!&rdquo; cried Peter. &ldquo;It does my heart good to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Peter,&rdquo; twittered Dotty happily. &ldquo;In a way it is good to be
      back. Certainly, it is good to know that an old friend is glad to see me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to stay all winter, Dotty?&rdquo; asked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; replied Dotty. &ldquo;I certainly shall if the snow does not get so
      deep that I cannot get enough to eat. Some of these weeds are so tall that
      it will take a lot of snow to cover them, and as long as the tops are
      above the snow I will have nothing to worry about. You know a lot of seeds
      remain in these tops all winter. But if the snow gets deep enough to cover
      these I shall have to move along farther south.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I hope there won't be much snow,&rdquo; declared Peter very emphatically.
      &ldquo;There are few enough folks about in winter at best, goodness knows, and I
      don't know of any one I enjoy having for a neighbor more than I do you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you again, Peter,&rdquo; cried Dotty, &ldquo;and please let me return the
      compliment. I like cold weather. I like winter when there isn't too much
      ice and bad weather. I always feel good in cold weather. That is one
      reason I go north to nest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speaking of nests, do you build in a tree?&rdquo; inquired Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Usually on or near the ground,&rdquo; replied Dotty. &ldquo;You know I am really a
      ground bird although I am called a Tree Sparrow. Most of us Sparrows spend
      our time on or near the ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; replied Peter. &ldquo;Do you know I'm very fond of the Sparrow family.
      I just love your cousin Chippy, who nests in the Old Orchard every spring.
      I wish he would stay all winter. I really don't see why he doesn't. I
      should think he could if you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dotty laughed. It was a tinkling little laugh, good to hear. &ldquo;Cousin
      Chippy would starve to death,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;It is all a matter of food.
      You ought to know that by this time, Peter. Cousin Chippy lives chiefly on
      worms and bugs and I live almost wholly on seeds, and that is what makes
      the difference. Cousin Chippy must go where he can get plenty to eat. I
      can get plenty here and so I stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you and your relatives come down from the Far North alone?&rdquo; asked
      Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Dotty promptly. &ldquo;Slaty the Junco and his relatives came
      along with us and we had a very merry party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter pricked up his ears. &ldquo;Is Slaty here now?&rdquo; he asked eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much here,&rdquo; replied a voice right behind Peter's back. It was so
      unexpected that it made Peter jump. He turned to find Slaty himself
      chuckling merrily as he picked up seeds. He was very nearly the same size
      as Dotty but trimmer. In fact he was one of the trimmest, neatest
      appearing of all of Peter's friends. There was no mistaking Slaty the
      Junco for any other bird. His head, throat and breast were clear slate
      color. Underneath he was white. His sides were grayish. His outer tail
      feathers were white. His bill was flesh color. It looked almost white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Welcome! Welcome!&rdquo; cried Peter. &ldquo;Are you here to stay all winter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly am,&rdquo; was Slaty's prompt response. &ldquo;It will take pretty bad
      weather to drive me away from here. If the snow gets too deep I'll just go
      up to Farmer Brown's barnyard. I can always pick up a meal there, for
      Farmer Brown's boy is a very good friend of mine. I know he won't let me
      starve, no matter what the weather is. I think it is going to snow some
      more. I like the snow. You know I am sometimes called the Snowbird.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter nodded. &ldquo;So I have heard,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;though I think that name really
      belongs to Snowflake the Snow Bunting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right, Peter, quite right,&rdquo; replied Slaty. &ldquo;I much prefer my own
      name of Junco. My, these seeds are good!&rdquo; All the time he was busily
      picking up seeds so tiny that Peter didn't even see them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you like here so much why don't you stay all the year?&rdquo; inquired
      Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It gets too warm,&rdquo; replied Slaty promptly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate hot weather. Give me cold weather every time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to tell me that it is cold all summer where you nest in the
      Far North?&rdquo; demanded Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly cold,&rdquo; replied Slaty, &ldquo;but a lot cooler than it is down here.
      I don't go as far north to nest as Snowflake does, but I go far enough to
      be fairly comfortable. I don't see how some folks can stand hot weather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a good thing they can,&rdquo; interrupted Dotty. &ldquo;If everybody liked the
      same things it wouldn't do at all. Just suppose all the birds ate nothing
      but seeds. There wouldn't be seeds enough to go around, and a lot of us
      would starve. Then, too, the worms and the bugs would eat up everything.
      So, take it all together, it is a mighty good thing that some birds live
      almost wholly on worms and bugs and such things, leaving the seeds to the
      rest of us. I guess Old Mother Nature knew what she was about when she
      gave us different tastes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter nodded his head in approval. &ldquo;You can always trust Old Mother Nature
      to know what is best,&rdquo; said he sagely. &ldquo;By the way, Slaty, what do you
      make your nest of and where do you put it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My nest is usually made of grasses, moss and rootlets. Sometimes it is
      lined with fine grasses, and when I am lucky enough to find them I use
      long hairs. Often I put my nest on the ground, and never very far above
      it. I am like my friend Dotty in this respect. It always seems to me
      easier to hide a nest on the ground than anywhere else. There is nothing
      like having a nest well hidden. It takes sharp eyes to find my nest, I can
      tell you that, Peter Rabbit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then Dotty, who had been picking seeds out of the top of a weed, gave
      a cry of alarm and instantly there was a flit of many wings as Dotty and
      his relatives and Slaty sought the shelter of the bushes along the edge of
      the field. Peter sat up very straight and looked this way and looked that
      way. At first he saw nothing suspicious. Then, crouching flat among the
      weeds, he got a glimpse of Black Pussy, the cat from Farmer Brown's house.
      She had been creeping up in the hope of catching one of those happy little
      seedeaters. Peter stamped angrily. Then with long jumps he started for the
      dear Old Briar-patch, lipperty-lipperty-lip, for truth to tell, big as he
      was, he was a little afraid of Black Pussy.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLI. More Friends Come With the Snow.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Slaty the Junco had been quite right in thinking it was going to snow some
      more. Rough Brother North Find hurried up one big cloud after another, and
      late that afternoon the white feathery flakes came drifting down out of
      the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Rabbit sat tight in the dear Old Briar-patch. In fact Peter did no
      moving about that night, but remained squatting just inside the entrance
      to an old hole Johnny Chuck's grandfather had dug long ago in the middle
      of the clear Old Briar-patch. Some time before morning the snow stopped
      falling and then rough Brother North Wind worked as hard to blow away the
      clouds as he had done to bring them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When jolly, round, bright Mr. Sun began his daily climb up in the blue,
      blue sky he looked down on a world of white. It seemed as if every little
      snowflake twinkled back at every little sunbeam. It was all very lovely,
      and Peter Rabbit rejoiced as he scampered forth in quest of his breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      He started first for the weedy field where the day before he had found
      Dotty the Tree Sparrow and Slaty the Junco. They were there before him,
      having the very best time ever was as they picked seeds from the tops of
      the weeds which showed above the snow. Almost at once Peter discovered
      that they were not the only seekers for seeds. Walking about on the snow,
      and quite as busy seeking seeds as were Dotty and Slaty, was a bird very
      near their size the top of whose head, neck and back were a soft
      rusty-brown. There was some black on his wings, but the latter were mostly
      white and the outer tail feathers were white. His breast and under parts
      were white. It was Snowflake the Snow Bunting in his winter suit. Peter
      knew him instantly. There was no mistaking him, for, as Peter well knew,
      there is no other bird of his size and shape who is so largely white. He
      had appeared so unexpectedly that it almost seemed as if he must have come
      out of the snow clouds just as had the snow itself. Peter had his usual
      question ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to spend the winter here, Snowflake?&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Snowflake was so busy getting his breakfast that he did not reply at once.
      Peter noticed that he did not hop, but walked or ran. Presently he paused
      long enough to reply to Peter's question. &ldquo;If the snow has come to stay
      all winter, perhaps I'll stay,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has the snow to do with it?&rdquo; demanded Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only that I like the snow and I like cold weather. When the snow begins
      to disappear, I just naturally fly back farther north,&rdquo; replied Snowflake.
      &ldquo;It isn't that I don't like bare ground, because I do, and I'm always glad
      when the snow is blown off in places so that I can hunt for seeds on the
      ground. But when the snow begins to melt everywhere I feel uneasy. I can't
      understand how folks can be contented where there is no snow and ice. You
      don't catch me going 'way down south. No, siree, you don't catch me going
      'way down south. Why, when the nesting season comes around, I chase Jack
      Frost clear 'way up to where he spends the summer. I nest 'way up on the
      shore of the Polar Sea, but of course you don't know where that is, Peter
      Rabbit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are so fond of the cold in the Far North, the snow and the ice,
      what did you come south at all for? Why don't you stay up there all the
      year around?&rdquo; demanded Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, Peter,&rdquo; replied Snowflake, twittering merrily, &ldquo;like everybody
      else, I have to eat in order to live. When you see me down here you may
      know that the snows up north are so deep that they have covered all the
      seeds. I always keep a weather eye out, as the saying is, and the minute
      it looks as if there would be too much snow for me to get a living, I move
      along. I hope I will not have to go any farther than this, but if some
      morning you wake up and find the snow so deep that all the heads of the
      weeds are buried, don't expect to find me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what I call good, sound common sense,&rdquo; said another voice, and a
      bird a little bigger than Snowflake, and who at first glance seemed to be
      dressed almost wholly in soft chocolate brown, alighted in the snow close
      by and at once began to run about in search of seeds. It was Wanderer the
      Horned Lark. Peter hailed him joyously, for there was something of mystery
      about Wanderer, and Peter, as you know, loves mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter had known him ever since his first winter, yet did not feel really
      acquainted, for Wanderer seldom stayed long enough for a real
      acquaintance. Every winter he would come, sometimes two or three times,
      but seldom staying more than a few days at a time. Quite often he and his
      relatives appeared with the Snowflakes, for they are the best of friends
      and travel much together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now as Wanderer reached up to pick seeds from a weed-top, Peter had a good
      look at him. The first things he noticed were the two little horn-like
      tufts of black feathers above and behind the eyes. It is from these that
      Wanderer gets the name of Horned Lark. No other bird has anything quite
      like them. His forehead, a line over each eye, and his throat were yellow.
      There was a black mark from each corner of the bill curving downward just
      below the eye and almost joining a black crescent-shaped band across the
      breast. Beneath this he was soiled white with dusky spots showing here and
      there. His back was brown, in places having almost a pinkish tinge. His
      tail was black, showing a little white on the edges when he flew. All
      together he was a handsome little fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do all of your family have those funny little horns?&rdquo; asked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; was Wanderer's prompt reply. &ldquo;Mrs. Lark does not have them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think they are very becoming,&rdquo; said Peter politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; replied Wanderer. &ldquo;I am inclined to agree with you. You
      should see me when I have my summer suit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it so very different from this?&rdquo; asked Peter. &ldquo;I think your present
      suit is pretty enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well said, Peter, well said,&rdquo; interrupted Snowflake. &ldquo;I quite agree with
      you. I think Wanderer's present suit is pretty enough for any one, but it
      is true that his summer suit is even prettier. It isn't so very different,
      but it is brighter, and those black markings are much stronger and show up
      better. You see, Wanderer is one of my neighbors in the Far North, and I
      know all about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that means that you don't know anything bad about me, doesn't it?&rdquo;
       chuckled Wanderer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Snowflake nodded. &ldquo;Not a thing,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I wouldn't ask for a better
      neighbor. You should hear him sing, Peter. He sings up in the air, and it
      really is a very pretty song.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd just love to hear him,&rdquo; replied Peter. &ldquo;Why don't you sing here,
      Wanderer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This isn't the singing season,&rdquo; replied Wanderer promptly. &ldquo;Besides,
      there isn't time to sing when one has to keep busy every minute in order
      to get enough to eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;why, when you get here, you don't stay in one
      place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it is easier to get a good living by moving about,&rdquo; replied
      Wanderer promptly. &ldquo;Besides, I like to visit new places. I shouldn't enjoy
      being tied down in just one place like some birds I know. Would you,
      Snowflake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Snowflake promptly replied that he wouldn't. Just then Peter discovered
      something that he hadn't known before. &ldquo;My goodness,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;what
      a long claw you have on each hind toe!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was true. Each hind claw was about twice as long as any other claw.
      Peter couldn't see any special use for it and he was just about to ask
      more about it when Wanderer suddenly spied a flock of his relatives some
      distance away and flew to join them. Probably this saved him some
      embarrassment, for it is doubtful if he himself knew why Old Mother Nature
      had given him such long hind claws.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLII. Peter Learns Something About Spooky.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Peter Rabbit likes winter. At least he doesn't mind it so very much, even
      though he has to really work for a living. Perhaps it is a good thing that
      he does, for he might grow too fat to keep out of the way of Reddy Fox.
      You see when the snow is deep Peter is forced to eat whatever he can, and
      very often there isn't much of anything for him but the bark of young
      trees. It is at such times that Peter gets into mischief, for there is no
      bark he likes better than that of young fruit trees. Now you know what
      happens when the bark is taken off all the way around the trunk of a tree.
      That tree dies. It dies for the simple reason that it is up the inner
      layer of bark that the life-giving sap travels in the spring and summer.
      Of course, when a strip of bark has been taken off all the way around near
      the base of a tree, the sap cannot go up and the tree must die.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now up near the Old Orchard Farmer Brown had set out a young orchard.
      Peter knew all about that young orchard, for he had visited it many times
      in the summer. Then there had been plenty of sweet clover and other green
      things to eat, and Peter had never been so much as tempted to sample the
      bark of those young trees. But now things were very different, and it was
      very seldom that Peter knew what it was to have a full stomach. He kept
      thinking of that young orchard. He knew that if he were wise he would keep
      away from there. But the more he thought of it the more it seemed to him
      that he just must have some of that tender young bark. So just at dusk one
      evening, Peter started for the young orchard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter got there in safety and his eyes sparkled as he hopped over to the
      nearest young tree. But when he reached it, Peter had a dreadful
      disappointment. All around the trunk of that young tree was wire netting.
      Peter couldn't get even a nibble of that bark. He tried the next tree with
      no better result. Then he hurried on from tree to tree, always with the
      same result. You see Farmer Brown knew all about Peter's liking for the
      bark of young fruit trees, and he had been wise enough to protect his
      young orchard.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Peter gave up and hopped over to the Old Orchard. As he passed a
      certain big tree he was startled by a voice. &ldquo;What's the matter, Peter?&rdquo;
       said the voice. &ldquo;You don't look happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter stopped short and stared up in the big apple-tree. Look as he would
      he couldn't see anybody. Of course there wasn't a leaf on that tree, and
      he could see all through it. Peter blinked and felt foolish. He knew that
      had there been any one sitting on any one of those branches he couldn't
      have helped seeing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't look so high, Peter; don't look so high,&rdquo; said the voice with a
      chuckle. This time it sounded as if it came right out of the trunk of the
      tree. Peter stared at the trunk and then suddenly laughed right out. Just
      a few feet above the ground was a good sized hole in the tree, and poking
      his head out of it was a funny little fellow with big eyes and a hooked
      beak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You certainly did fool me that time, Spooky,&rdquo; cried Peter. &ldquo;I ought to
      have recognized your voice, but I didn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Spooky the Screech Owl, for that is who it was, came out of the hole in
      the tree and without a sound from his wings flew over and perched just
      above Peter's head. He was a little fellow, not over eight inches high,
      but there was no mistaking the family to which he belonged. In fact he
      looked very much like a small copy of Hooty the Great Horned Owl, so much
      so that Peter felt a little cold shiver run over him, although he had
      nothing in the world to fear from Spooky.
    </p>
    <p>
      His head seemed to be almost as big around as his body, and he seemed to
      leave no neck at all. He was dressed in bright reddish-brown, with little
      streaks and bars of black. Underneath he was whitish, with little streaks
      and bars of black and brown. On each side of his head was a tuft of
      feathers. They looked like ears and some people think they are ears, which
      is a mistake. His eyes were round and yellow with a fierce hungry look in
      them. His bill was small and almost hidden among the feathers of his face,
      but it was hooked just like the bill of Hooty. As he settled himself he
      turned his head around until he could look squarely behind him, then
      brought it back again so quickly that to Peter it looked as if it had gone
      clear around. You see Spooky's eyes are fixed in their sockets and he
      cannot move them from side to side. He has to turn his whole head in order
      to see to one side or the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven't told me yet why you look so unhappy, Peter,&rdquo; said Spooky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't an empty stomach enough to make any fellow unhappy?&rdquo; retorted Peter
      rather shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spooky chuckled. &ldquo;I've got an empty stomach myself, Peter,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but
      it isn't making me unhappy. I have a feeling that somewhere there is a fat
      Mouse waiting for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then Peter remembered what Jenny Wren had told him early in the
      spring of how Spooky the Screech Owl lives all the year around in a hollow
      tree, and curiosity made him forget for the time being that he was hungry.
      &ldquo;Did you live in that hole all summer, Spooky?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spooky nodded solemnly. &ldquo;I've lived in that hollow summer and winter for
      three years,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter's eyes opened very wide. &ldquo;And till now I never even guessed it,&rdquo; he
      exclaimed. &ldquo;Did you raise a family there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly did,&rdquo; replied Spooky. &ldquo;Mrs. Spooky and I raised a family of
      four as fine looking youngsters as you ever have seen. They've gone out
      into the Great World to make their own living now. Two were dressed just
      like me and two were gray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; exclaimed Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said that two were dressed just like me and two were gray,&rdquo; replied
      Spooky rather sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's funny,&rdquo; Peter exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's funny?&rdquo; snapped Spooky rather crossly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why that all four were not dressed alike,&rdquo; said Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's nothing funny about it,&rdquo; retorted Spooky, and snapped his bill
      sharply with a little cracking sound. &ldquo;We Screech Owls believe in variety.
      Some of us are gray and some of us are reddish-brown. It is a case of
      where you cannot tell a person just by the color of his clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter nodded as if he quite understood, although he couldn't understand at
      all. &ldquo;I'm ever so pleased to find you living here,&rdquo; said he politely. &ldquo;You
      see, in winter the Old Orchard is rather a lonely place. I don't see how
      you get enough to eat when there are so few birds about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Birds!&rdquo; snapped Spooky. &ldquo;What have birds to do with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, don't you live on birds?&rdquo; asked Peter innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say not. I guess I would starve if I depended on birds for my
      daily food,&rdquo; retorted Spooky. &ldquo;I catch a Sparrow now and then, to be sure,
      but usually it is an English Sparrow, and I consider that I am doing the
      Old Orchard a good turn every time I am lucky enough to catch one of the
      family of Bully the English Sparrow. But I live mostly on Mice and Shrews
      in winter and in summer I eat a lot of grasshoppers and other insects. If
      it wasn't for me and my relatives I guess Mice would soon overrun the
      Great World. Farmer Brown ought to be glad I've come to live in the Old
      Orchard and I guess he is, for Farmer Brown's boy knows all about this
      house of mine and never disturbs me. Now if you'll excuse me I think I'll
      fly over to Farmer Brown's young orchard. I ought to find a fat Mouse or
      two trying to get some of the bark from those young trees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; exclaimed Peter. &ldquo;They can try all they want to, but they won't get
      any; I can tell you that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Spooky's round yellow eyes twinkled. &ldquo;It must be you have been trying to
      get some of that bark yourself,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter didn't say anything but he looked guilty, and Spooky once more
      chuckled as he spread his wings and flew away so soundlessly that he
      seemed more like a drifting shadow than a bird. Then Peter started for a
      certain swamp he knew of where he would be sure to find enough bark to
      stay his appetite.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIII. Queer Feet and a Queerer Bill.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Peter Rabbit had gone over to the Green Forest to call on his cousin,
      Jumper the Hare, who lives there altogether. He had no difficulty in
      finding Jumper's tracks in the snow, and by following these he at length
      came up with Jumper. The fact is, Peter almost bumped into Jumper before
      he saw him, for Jumper was wearing a coat as white as the snow itself.
      Squatting under a little snow-covered hemlock-tree he looked like nothing
      more than a little mound of snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Peter. &ldquo;How you startled me! I wish I had a winter coat like
      yours. It must be a great help in avoiding your enemies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It certainly is, Cousin Peter,&rdquo; cried Jumper. &ldquo;Nine times out of ten all
      I have to do is to sit perfectly still when there was no wind to carry my
      scent. I have had Reddy Fox pass within a few feet of me and never suspect
      that I was near. I hope this snow will last all winter. It is only when
      there isn't any snow that I am particularly worried. Then I am not easy
      for a minute, because my white coat can be seen a long distance against
      the brown of the dead leaves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter chuckled, &ldquo;that is just when I feel safest,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I like the
      snow, but this brown-gray coat of mine certainly does show up against it.
      Don't you find it pretty lonesome over here in the Green Forest with all
      the birds gone, Cousin Jumper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jumper shook his head. &ldquo;Not all have gone, Peter, you know,&rdquo; said he.
      &ldquo;Strutter the Grouse and Mrs. Grouse are here, and I see them every day.
      They've got snowshoes now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter blinked his eyes and looked rather perplexed. &ldquo;Snowshoes!&rdquo; he
      exclaimed. &ldquo;I don't understand what you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; replied Jumper, &ldquo;and I'll show you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Jumper led the way and Peter followed close at his heels. Presently
      they came to some tracks in the snow. At first glance they reminded Peter
      of the queer tracks Farmer Brown's ducks made in the mud on the edge of
      the Smiling Pool in summer. &ldquo;What funny tracks those are!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
      &ldquo;Who made them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just keep on following me and you'll see,&rdquo; retorted Jumper.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they continued to follow the tracks until presently, just ahead of
      them, they saw Strutter the Grouse. Peter opened his eyes with surprise
      when he discovered that those queer tracks were made by Strutter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cousin Peter wants to see your snowshoes, Strutter,&rdquo; said Jumper as they
      came up with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strutter's bright eyes sparkled. &ldquo;He's just as curious as ever, isn't he?&rdquo;
       said he. &ldquo;Well, I don't mind showing him my snowshoes because I think
      myself that they are really quite wonderful.&rdquo; He held up one foot with the
      toes spread apart and Peter saw that growing out from the sides of each
      toe were queer little horny points set close together. They quite filled
      the space between his toes. Peter recalled that when he had seen Strutter
      in the summer those toes had been smooth and that his tracks on soft
      ground had shown the outline of each toe clearly. &ldquo;How funny!&rdquo; exclaimed
      Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's nothing funny about them,&rdquo; retorted Strutter. &ldquo;If Old Mother
      Nature hadn't given me something of this kind I certainly would have a
      hard time of it when there is snow on the ground. If my feet were just the
      same as in summer I would sink right down in when the snow is soft and
      wouldn't be able to walk about at all. Now, with these snowshoes I get
      along very nicely. You see I sink in but very little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took three or four steps and Peter saw right away how very useful those
      snowshoes were. &ldquo;My!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I wish Old Mother Nature would give
      me snowshoes too.&rdquo; Strutter and Jumper both laughed and after a second
      Peter laughed with them, for he realized how impossible it would be for
      him to have anything like those snowshoes of Strutter's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cousin Peter was just saying that he should think I would find it
      lonesome over here in the Green Forest. He forgot that you and Mrs. Grouse
      stay all winter, and he forgot that while most of the birds who spent the
      summer here have left, there are others who come down from the Far North
      to take their place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who, for instance?&rdquo; demanded Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Snipper the Crossbill,&rdquo; replied Jumper promptly. &ldquo;I haven't seen him yet
      this winter, but I know he is here because only this morning I found some
      pine seeds on the snow under a certain tree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; Peter exclaimed. &ldquo;That doesn't prove anything. Those seeds might
      have just fallen, or Chatterer the Red Squirrel might have dropped them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This isn't the season for seeds to just fall, and I know by the signs
      that Chatterer hasn't been about,&rdquo; retorted Jumper. &ldquo;Let's go over there
      now and see what we will see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more he led the way and Peter followed. As they drew near that
      certain pine-tree, a short whistled note caused them to look up. Busily at
      work on a pine cone near the top of a tree was a bird about the size of
      Bully the English Sparrow. He was dressed wholly in dull red with
      brownish-black wings and tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did I tell you?&rdquo; cried Jumper. &ldquo;There's Snipper this very minute,
      and over in that next tree are a lot of his family and relatives. See in
      what a funny way they climb about among the branches. They don't flit or
      hop, but just climb around. I don't know of any other bird anywhere around
      here that does that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then a seed dropped and landed on the snow almost in front of Peter's
      nose. Almost at once Snipper himself followed it, picking it up and eating
      it with as much unconcern as if Peter and Jumper were a mile away instead
      of only a foot or so. The very first thing Peter noticed was Snipper's
      bill. The upper and lower halves crossed at the tips. That bill looked
      very much as if Snipper had struck something hard and twisted the tips
      over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have&mdash;have&mdash;you met with an accident?&rdquo; he asked a bit
      hesitatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Snipper looked surprised. &ldquo;Are you talking to me?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Whatever put
      such an idea into your head?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your bill,&rdquo; replied Peter promptly. &ldquo;How did it get twisted like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Snipper laughed. &ldquo;It isn't twisted,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It is just the way Old
      Mother Nature made it, and I really don't know what I'd do if it were any
      different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter scratched one long ear, as is his way when he is puzzled. &ldquo;I don't
      see,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;how it is possible for you to pick up food with a bill
      like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I don't see how I would get my food if I didn't have a bill like
      this,&rdquo; retorted Snipper. Then, seeing how puzzled Peter really was, he
      went on to explain. &ldquo;You see, I live very largely on the seeds that grow
      in pine cones and the cones of other trees. Of course I eat some other
      food, such as seeds and buds of trees. But what I love best of all are the
      seeds that grow in the cones of evergreen trees. If you've ever looked at
      one of those cones, you will understand that those seeds are not very easy
      to get at. But with this kind of a bill it is no trouble at all. I can
      snip them out just as easily as birds with straight bills can pick up
      seeds. You see my bill is very much like a pair of scissors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It really is very wonderful,&rdquo; confessed Peter. &ldquo;Do you mind telling me,
      Snipper, why I never have seen you here in summer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the same reason that in summer you never see Snowflake and Wanderer
      the Horned Lark and some others I might name,&rdquo; replied Snipper. &ldquo;Give me
      the Far North every time. I would stay there the year through but that
      sometimes food gets scarce up there. That is why I am down here now. If
      you'll excuse me, I'll go finish my breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Snipper flew up in the tree where the other Crossbills were at work and
      Peter and Jumper watched them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you know,&rdquo; said Jumper, &ldquo;that Snipper has a cousin who looks
      almost exactly like him with the exception of two white bars on each wing.
      He is called the White-winged Crossbill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't know it,&rdquo; replied Peter, &ldquo;but I'm glad you've told me. I
      certainly shall watch out for him. I can't get over those funny bills. No
      one could ever mistake it for any other bird. Is there anyone else now
      from the Far North whom I haven't seen?&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIV. More Folks in Red.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Jumper the Hare didn't have time to reply to Peter Rabbit's question when
      Peter asked if there was any one else besides the Crossbills who had come
      down from the Far North.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; said a voice from a tree just back of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was so unexpected that it made both Peter and Jumper hop in startled
      surprise. Then they turned to see who had spoken. There sat a bird just a
      little smaller than Welcome Robin, who at first glance seemed to be
      dressed in strawberry-red. However, a closer look showed that there were
      slate-gray markings about his head, under his wings and on his legs. His
      tail was brown. His wings were brown, marked with black and white and
      slate. His bill was thick and rather short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; demanded Peter very bluntly and impolitely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm Piny the Pine Grosbeak,&rdquo; replied the stranger, seemingly not at all
      put out by Peter's bluntness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;Are you related to Rosebreast the Grosbeak who nested
      last summer in the Old Orchard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly am,&rdquo; replied Piny. &ldquo;He is my very own cousin. I've never seen
      him because he never ventures up where I live and I don't go down where he
      spends the winter, but all members of the Grosbeak family are cousins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rosebreast is very lovely and I'm very fond of him,&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;We are
      very good friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I know we are going to be good friends,&rdquo; replied Piny. As he said
      this he turned and Peter noticed that his tail was distinctly forked
      instead of being square across like that of Welcome Robin. Piny whistled,
      and almost at once he was joined by another bird who in shape was just
      like him, but who was dressed in slaty-gray and olive-yellow, instead of
      the bright red that he himself wore. Piny introduced the newcomer as Mrs.
      Grosbeak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lovely weather, isn't it?&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I love the snow. I wouldn't feel at
      home with no snow about. Why, last spring I even built my nest before the
      snow was gone in the Far North. We certainly hated to leave up there, but
      food was getting so scarce that we had to. We have just arrived. Can you
      tell me if there are any cedar-trees or ash-trees or sumacs near here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter hastened to tell her just where she would find these trees and then
      rather timidly asked why she wanted to find them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because they hold their berries all winter,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Grosbeak
      promptly, &ldquo;and those berries make very good eating. I rather thought there
      must be some around here. If there are enough of them we certainly shall
      stay a while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you will,&rdquo; replied Peter. &ldquo;I want to get better acquainted with
      you. You know, if it were not for you folks who come down from the Far
      North the Green Forest would be rather a lonely place in winter. There are
      times when I like to be alone, but I like to feel that there is someone I
      can call on when I feel lonesome. Did you and Piny come down alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Grosbeak. &ldquo;There is a flock of our relatives
      not far away. We came down with the Crossbills. All together we made quite
      a party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter and Jumper stayed a while to gossip with the Grosbeaks. Then Peter
      bethought him that it was high time for him to return to the dear Old
      Briar-patch, and bidding his new friends good-by, he started off through
      the Green Forest, lipperty-lipperty-lip. When he reached the edge of the
      Green Forest he decided to run over to the weedy field to see if the
      Snowflakes and the Tree Sparrows and the Horned Larks were there. They
      were, but almost at once Peter discovered that they had company.
      Twittering cheerfully as he busily picked seeds out of the top of a weed
      which stood above the snow, was a bird very little bigger than Chicoree
      the Goldfinch. But when Peter looked at him he just had to rub his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious goodness!&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;it must be something is wrong with my
      eyes so that I am seeing red. I've already seen two birds dressed in red
      and now there's another. It certainly must be my eyes. There's Dotty the
      Tree Sparrow over there; I hear his voice. I wonder if he will look red.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter hopped near enough to get a good look at Dotty and found him dressed
      just as he should be. That relieved Peter's mind. His eyes were quite as
      they should be. Then he returned to look at the happy little stranger
      still busily picking seeds from that weed-top.
    </p>
    <p>
      The top of his head was bright red. There was no doubt about it. His back
      was toward Peter at the time and but for that bright red cap Peter
      certainly would have taken him for one of his friends among the Sparrow
      family. You see his back was grayish-brown. Peter could think of several
      Sparrows with backs very much like it. But when he looked closely he saw
      that just above his tail this little stranger wore a pinkish patch, and
      that was something no Sparrow of Peter's acquaintance possesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the lively little stranger turned to face Peter and a pair of bright
      eyes twinkled mischievously. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;how do you like my
      appearance? Anything wrong with me? I was taught that it is very impolite
      to stare at any one. I guess your mother forgot to teach you manners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter paid no attention to what was said but continued to stare. &ldquo;My, how
      pretty you are!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little stranger WAS pretty. His breast was PINK. Below this he was
      white. The middle of his throat was black and his sides were streaked with
      reddish-brown. He looked pleased at Peter's exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad you think I'm pretty,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I like pink myself. I like it
      very much indeed. I suppose you've already seen my friends, Snipper the
      Crossbill and Piny the Grosbeak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter promptly bobbed his head. &ldquo;I've just come from making their
      acquaintance,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;By the way you speak, I presume you also are from
      the Far North. I am just beginning to learn that there are more folks who
      make their homes in the Far North than I had dreamed of. If you please, I
      don't believe I know you at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm Redpoll,&rdquo; was the prompt response. &ldquo;I am called that because of my
      red cap. Yes, indeed, I make my home in the Far North. There is no place
      like it. You really ought to run up there and get acquainted with the
      folks who make their homes there and love it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Redpoll laughed at his own joke, but Peter didn't see the joke at all. &ldquo;Is
      it so very far?&rdquo; he asked innocently; then added, &ldquo;I'd dearly love to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Redpoll laughed harder than ever. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it is. I am afraid you
      would be a very old and very gray Rabbit by the time you got there. I
      guess the next thing is for you to make the acquaintance of some of us who
      get down here once in awhile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Redpoll called softly and almost at once was joined by another red-capped
      bird but without the pink breast, and with sides more heavily streaked.
      &ldquo;This is Mrs. Redpoll,&rdquo; announced her lively little mate. Then he turned
      to her and added, &ldquo;I've just been telling Peter Rabbit that as long as he
      cannot visit our beautiful Far North he must become acquainted with those
      of us who come down here in the winter. I'm sure he'll find us very
      friendly folks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sure I shall,&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;If you please, do you live altogether on
      these weed seeds?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Redpoll laughed his usual happy laugh. &ldquo;Hardly, Peter,&rdquo; replied he. &ldquo;We
      like the seeds of the birches and the alders, and we eat the seeds of the
      evergreen trees when we get them. Sometimes we find them in cones Snipper
      the Crossbill has opened but hasn't picked all the seeds out of. Sometimes
      he drops some for us. Oh, we always manage to get plenty to eat. There are
      some of our relatives over there and we must join them. We'll see you
      again, Peter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter said he hoped they would and then watched them fly over to join
      their friends. Suddenly, as if a signal had been given, all spread their
      wings at the same instant and flew up in a birch-tree not far away. All
      seemed to take wing at precisely the same instant. Up in the birch-tree
      they sat for a minute or so and then, just as if another signal had been
      given, all began to pick out the tiny seeds from the birch tassels. No one
      bird seemed to be first. It was quite like a drill, or as if each had
      thought of the same thing at the same instant. Peter chuckled over it all
      the way home. And somehow he felt better for having made the acquaintance
      of the Redpolls. It was the feeling that everybody so fortunate as to meet
      them on a gold winter's day is sure to have.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLV. Peter Sees Two Terrible Feathered Hunters.
    </h2>
    <p>
      While it is true that Peter Rabbit likes winter, it is also true that life
      is anything but easy for him that season. In the first place he has to
      travel about a great deal to get sufficient food, and that means that he
      must run more risks. There isn't a minute of day or night that he is
      outside of the dear Old Briar-patch when he can afford not to watch and
      listen for danger. You see, at this season of the year, Reddy Fox often
      finds it difficult to get a good meal. He is hungry most of the time, and
      he is forever hunting for Peter Rabbit. With snow on the ground and no
      leaves on the bushes and young trees, it is not easy for Peter to hide.
      So, as he travels about, the thought of Reddy Fox is always in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there are others whom Peter fears even more, and these wear feathers
      instead of fur coats. One of these is Terror the Goshawk. Peter is not
      alone in his fear of Terror. There is not one among his feathered friends
      who will not shiver at the mention of Terror's name. Peter will not soon
      forget the day he discovered that Terror had come down from the Far North,
      and was likely to stay for the rest of the winter. Peter went hungry all
      the rest of that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      You see it was this way: Peter had gone over to the Green Forest very
      early that morning in the hope of getting breakfast in a certain swamp. He
      was hopping along, lipperty-lipperty-lip, with his thoughts chiefly on
      that breakfast he hoped to get, but at the same time with ears and eyes
      alert for possible danger, when a strange feeling swept over him. It was a
      feeling that great danger was very near, though he saw nothing and heard
      nothing to indicate it. It was just a feeling, that was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Peter has learned that the wise thing to do when one has such a
      feeling as that is to seek safety first and investigate afterwards. At the
      instant he felt that strange feeling of fear he was passing a certain big,
      hollow log. Without really knowing why he did it, because, you know, he
      didn't stop to do any thinking, he dived into that hollow log, and even as
      he did so there was the sharp swish of great wings. Terror the Goshawk had
      missed catching Peter by the fraction of a second.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his heart thumping as if it were trying to pound its way through his
      ribs, Peter peeped out of that hollow log. Terror had alighted on a tall
      stump only a few feet away. To Peter in his fright he seemed the biggest
      bird he ever had seen. Of course he wasn't. Actually he was very near the
      same size as Redtail the Hawk, whom Peter knew well. He was handsome.
      There was no denying the fact that he was handsome.
    </p>
    <p>
      His back was bluish. His head seemed almost black. Over and behind each
      eye was a white line. Underneath he was beautifully marked with wavy bars
      of gray and white. On his tail were four dark bands. Yes, he was handsome.
      But Peter had no thought for his beauty. He could see nothing but the
      fierceness of the eyes that were fixed on the entrance to that hollow log.
      Peter shivered as if with a cold chill. He knew that in Terror was no pity
      or gentleness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; thought Peter, &ldquo;that Mr. and Mrs. Grouse are nowhere about.&rdquo; You
      see he knew that there is no one that Terror would rather catch than a
      member of the Grouse family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Terror did not sit on that stump long. He knew that Peter was not likely
      to come out in a hurry. Presently he flew away, and Peter suspected from
      the direction in which he was headed that Terror was going over to visit
      Farmer Brown's henyard. Of all the members of the Hawk family there is
      none more bold than Terror the Goshawk. He would not hesitate to seize a
      hen from almost beneath Farmer Brown's nose. He is well named, for the
      mere suspicion that he is anywhere about strikes terror to the heart of
      all the furred and feathered folks. He is so swift of wing that few can
      escape him, and he has no pity, but kills for the mere love of killing. In
      this respect he is like Shadow the Weasel. To kill for food is forgiven by
      the little people of the Green Forest and the Green Meadows, but to kill
      needlessly is unpardonable. This is why Terror the Goshawk is universally
      hated and has not a single friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that day Peter remained hidden in that hollow log. He did not dare put
      foot outside until the Black Shadows began to creep through the Green
      Forest. Then he knew that there was nothing more to fear from Terror the
      Goshawk, for he hunts only by day. Once more Peter's thoughts were chiefly
      of his stomach, for it was very, very empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was not intended that Peter should fill his stomach at once. He had
      gone but a little way when from just ahead of him the silence of the early
      evening was broken by a terrifying sound&mdash;&ldquo;Whooo-hoo-hoo, whooo-hoo!&rdquo;
       It was so sudden and there was in it such a note of fierceness that Peter
      had all he could do to keep from jumping and running for dear life. But he
      knew that voice and he knew, too, that safety lay in keeping perfectly
      still. So with his heart thumping madly, as when he had escaped from
      Terror that morning, Peter sat as still as if he could not move.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the hunting call of Hooty the Great Horned Owl, and it had been
      intended to frighten some one into jumping and running, or at least into
      moving ever so little. Peter knew all about that trick of Hooty's. He knew
      that in all the Green Forest there are no ears so wonderful as those of
      Hooty the Owl, and that the instant he had uttered that fierce hunting
      call he had strained those wonderful ears to catch the faintest sound
      which some startled little sleeper of the night might make. The rustle of
      a leaf would be enough to bring Hooty to the spot on his great silent
      wings, and then his fierce yellow eyes, which are made for seeing in the
      dusk, would find the victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Peter sat still, fearful that the very thumping of his heart might
      reach those wonderful ears. Again that terrible hunting cry rang out, and
      again Peter had all he could do to keep from jumping. But he didn't jump,
      and a few minutes later, as he sat staring at a certain tall, dead stub of
      a tree, wondering just where Hooty was, the top of that stub seemed to
      break off, and a great, broad-winged bird flew away soundlessly like a
      drifting shadow. It was Hooty himself. Sitting perfectly straight on the
      top of that tall, dead stub he had seemed a part of it. Peter waited some
      time before he ventured to move. Finally he heard Hooty's hunting call in
      a distant part of the Green Forest, and knew that it was safe for him to
      once more think of his empty stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later in the winter while the snow still lay in the Green Forest, and the
      ice still bound the Laughing Brook, Peter made a surprising discovery. He
      was over in a certain lonely part of the Green Forest when he happened to
      remember that near there was an old nest which had once belonged to
      Redtail the Hawk. Out of idle curiosity Peter ran over for a look at that
      old nest. Imagine how surprised he was when just as he came within sight
      of it, he saw a great bird just settling down on it. Peter's heart jumped
      right up in his throat. At least that is the way it seemed, for he
      recognized Mrs. Hooty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course Peter stopped right where he was and took the greatest care not
      to move or make a sound. Presently Hooty himself appeared and perched in a
      tree near at hand. Peter has seen Hooty many times before, but always as a
      great, drifting shadow in the moonlight. Now he could see him clearly. As
      he sat bolt upright he seemed to be of the same height as Terror the
      Goshawk, but with a very much bigger body. If Peter had but known it, his
      appearance of great size was largely due to the fluffy feathers in which
      Hooty was clothed. Like his small cousin, Spooky the Screech Owl, Hooty
      seemed to have no neck at all. He looked as if his great head was set
      directly on his shoulders. From each side of his head two great tufts of
      feathers stood out like ears or horns. His bill was sharply hooked. He was
      dressed wholly in reddish-brown with little buff and black markings, and
      on his throat was a white patch. His legs were feathered, and so were his
      feet clear to the great claws.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was on the great, round, fierce, yellow eyes that Peter kept his
      own eyes. He had always thought of Hooty as being able to see only in the
      dusk of evening or on moonlight nights, but somehow he had a feeling that
      even now in broad daylight Hooty could see perfectly well, and he was
      quite right.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time Peter sat there without moving. He dared not do anything
      else. After he had recovered from his first fright he began to wonder what
      Hooty and Mrs. Hooty were doing at that old nest. His curiosity was
      aroused. He felt that he simply must find out. By and by Hooty flew away
      very carefully, so as not to attract the attention of Mrs. Hooty. Peter
      stole back the way he had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was far enough away to feel reasonably safe, he scampered as fast
      as ever he could. He wanted to get away from that place, and he wanted to
      find some one of whom he could ask questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he met his cousin, Jumper the Hare, and at once in a most
      excited manner told him all he had seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jumper listened until Peter was through. &ldquo;If you'll take my advice,&rdquo; said
      he, &ldquo;you'll keep away from that part of the Green Forest, Cousin Peter.
      From what you tell me it is quite clear to me that the Hooties have begun
      nesting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nesting!&rdquo; exclaimed Peter. &ldquo;Nesting! Why, gentle Mistress Spring will not
      get here for a month yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said NESTING,&rdquo; retorted Jumper, speaking rather crossly, for you see he
      did not like to have his word doubted. &ldquo;Hooty the Great Horned Owl doesn't
      wait for Mistress Spring. He and Mrs. Hooty believe in getting household
      cares out of the way early. Along about this time of year they hunt up an
      old nest of Redtail the Hawk or Blacky the Crow or Chatterer the Red
      Squirrel, for they do not take the trouble to build a nest themselves.
      Then Mrs. Hooty lays her eggs while there is still snow and ice. Why their
      youngsters don't catch their death from cold when they hatch out is more
      than I can say. But they don't. I'm sorry to hear that the Hooties have a
      nest here this year. It means a bad time for a lot of little folks in
      feathers and fur. I certainly shall keep away in from that part of the
      Green Forest, and I advise you to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter said that he certainly should, and then started on for the dear Old
      Briar-patch to think things over. The discovery that already the nesting
      season of a new year had begun turned Peter's thoughts towards the coming
      of sweet Mistress Spring and the return of his many feathered friends who
      had left for the far-away South so long before. A great longing to hear
      the voices of Welcome Robin and Winsome Bluebird and Little Friend the
      Song Sparrow swept over him, and a still greater longing for a bit of
      friendly gossip with Jenny Wren. In the past year he had learned much
      about his feathered neighbors, but there were still many things he wanted
      to know, things which only Jenny Wren could tell him. He was only just
      beginning to find out that no one knows all there is to know, especially
      about the birds. And no one ever will.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
